# nestedtune 0.0.0.9000

* A new site-only article, "Why nest: a simulation" (`articles/why-nest` on
  the package site, not shipped in the package), reads a stored simulation in
  which each replicate draws wide data with no signal, tunes a small neural
  network over a grid, and records the best candidate's cross-validation
  accuracy from a flat `tune::tune_grid()` run beside the estimate from
  `nested_tune_grid()`. The page prints the design, both medians and the
  distance of each from the true accuracy from the stored object, and draws
  both distributions across replicates against a line at the truth. The
  script that produces the store, `vignettes/articles/why-nest-sim.R`, is
  not shipped either and says at its head what it needs.

* A new site-only article, "Running the outer loop in parallel"
  (`articles/parallel` on the package site, not shipped in the package),
  starts two mirai daemons, runs the getting-started guide's loop on them,
  shows `identical()` on the outer scores, the selections and the tuning
  seeds against the same run made serially returning `TRUE`, and walks the
  daemon pre-flight, what crosses the wire to each daemon, developing
  against daemons under `devtools::load_all()`, interrupting a run, and the
  `nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable` warning a pool started without a
  dispatcher raises. The page builds only where mirai and ranger are
  installed, and is one notice otherwise.

* A new vignette, `vignette("results")` ("Reading the results"), reads the
  `nested_results` object: one sentence and an executed peek per column,
  `summary()`, `collect_metrics()` with and without `summarize = FALSE`,
  `agreement()` and both `autoplot()` views; a run in which one outer fold
  fails on a `recipes::check_range()` step, that fold's `.notes`, and the
  `nestedtune_partial_summary` warning `summary()` raises over it; which
  dplyr operations keep the class and which shed it; and a censored-regression
  run with `eval_time` at two times whose `collect_metrics()` carries
  `.eval_time`, with `event_level` explained beside it. The censored-regression
  section runs only where censored and survival are installed, and is one
  notice otherwise.

* A new vignette, `vignette("tuners")` ("Choosing the inner tuner"), runs
  `nested_tune_bayes()`, `nested_tune_race_anova()`,
  `nested_tune_race_win_loss()` and `nested_tune_sim_anneal()` on the
  getting-started guide's design and workflow, prints what one fold's
  `.inner_metrics` records for each, passes a `tune::control_bayes()` through
  `...` and reads the recorded `procedure`, and says what differs from calling
  tune or finetune directly. The racing sections build only where finetune,
  lme4 and BradleyTerry2 are installed, and the annealing section where
  finetune is.

* The guide `vignette("nested-cv")` is now the getting-started path alone:
  design, loop, what to report, what each fold chose, the final fit,
  reproducibility and the write-up. What the nested estimate means moved to a
  new page, `vignette("estimate")`: which quantity it estimates, why it tends
  to run a little pessimistic, what `std_err` is and is not, why two nested
  estimates cannot be subtracted to compare workflows, why the outer folds
  disagree, and when nesting is worth its cost. The new page runs no code.

* `nested_tune_grid()`, `nested_tune_bayes()`, `nested_tune_race_anova()`,
  `nested_tune_race_win_loss()` and `nested_tune_sim_anneal()` refuse a
  `resamples` design at the call, before any fold runs, in three further
  shapes, under the same `nestedtune_bad_design` class: an element of some
  fold's inner `splits` list that is not an `rsplit`; a fold whose inner
  splits do not all carry one frame that is the outer split's own data frame
  (as `nested_resamples()` builds them) or that split's analysis set (as
  `rsample::nested_cv()` builds them); and an inner split carrying the outer
  data frame whose `in_id`, or non-`NA` `out_id`, holds a row index outside
  the outer split's `in_id`. Each refusal names every offending fold, split
  and index. Before, an inner design over another frame was tuned as given
  serially and sent down a slower path in parallel, and a hand-built inner
  split indexing a row its outer fold holds out ran to completion. Designs
  from `nested_resamples()` and `rsample::nested_cv()`, on a data frame or a
  tibble, and one whose outer `rset` repeats a row, pass unchanged.

* Before any fold is dispatched to mirai daemons, the startup check now asks
  every daemon for each package the workflow and the tuner need, and stops
  when one cannot load one of them, naming how many daemons are affected and
  which packages: the `nestedtune_daemons_missing_pkgs` refusal, or the
  existing `nestedtune_daemons_cannot_load` one when a daemon also cannot
  load nestedtune itself, both under `nestedtune_daemons_unusable`. Before,
  such a pool was warned about and then failed every fold sent to that
  daemon. The host's own entry check widens the same way: a package the
  workflow needs that is not installed here -- a recipe step's as well as the
  engine's -- is refused at entry by every tuning driver and by
  `nested_final_fit()`, under the `nestedtune_pkg_not_installed` class the
  tuner refusals already carry, with an `install.packages()` call to paste.

* `extract_tune_results()` and `extract_scored_candidates()` on an object
  they have no method for -- a `nested_results`, a list, a number -- now
  signal the `nestedtune_no_extract_method` refusal naming that object
  whatever else was passed in `...`. Before, a stray argument was reported
  first and the object not at all.

* Three compatibility changes to the `nested_results` class. Printing the
  columnless type token `vctrs::vec_cbind_frame_ptype()` hands back no
  longer errors, and writes the banner and the rows alone: neither the
  outer-label line nor a fold count. A column add that leaves two columns
  sharing a record column's name -- `vctrs::vec_cbind()` or
  `dplyr::bind_cols()` with `.name_repair = "minimal"` -- returns a bare
  tibble carrying none of the run's attributes, as a repair that moves the
  column already did; two columns outside the record sharing a name leave
  the object as it is. And `names<-`, the door `dplyr::rename()` uses,
  keeps the object and every attribute intact when each record column keeps
  its name, a rename that duplicates a name outside the record included,
  and returns a bare tibble when a record column is renamed or a column
  outside the record takes one's name.

* `nested_tune_grid()`, `nested_tune_bayes()`, `nested_tune_race_anova()`,
  `nested_tune_race_win_loss()` and `nested_tune_sim_anneal()` refuse a
  `resamples` design at the call, before any fold runs, in three new shapes:
  an inner `rset` with no rows; an `NA` label, or two outer folds carrying the
  same label; and a label column -- any column beside `splits` and
  `inner_resamples` -- that is not character or factor, or whose name is not
  `id` or `id` followed by a digit from 1 to 9, the names rsample's and
  tune's own readers find id columns by. Every design refusal, the six that
  existed included (not a nested design, no outer folds, no `id` column, an
  outer bootstrap, a `splits` element that is not an `rsplit`, an
  `inner_resamples` element that is not an `rset`), now carries the condition
  class `nestedtune_bad_design`, and a refusal names every offending row or
  column rather than the first it found. Designs from `nested_resamples()`
  and `rsample::nested_cv()` pass unchanged.

* On a `nested_resamples()` design, every inner tuning call now sees only its
  outer fold's analysis rows, so a `param_info` parameter whose range tune
  finalizes from the data -- `mtry()`, or a `min_n()` finalized by row
  count -- is finalized without the rows that fold holds out, as it already
  was on an `rsample::nested_cv()` design. Before, tune read the whole data
  frame the design's inner splits index: on a 200-row frame with five outer
  folds, a `min_n` finalized at half the row count searched candidates up to
  100 where the fold's 160 analysis rows give 80. The candidates such a run
  searches, and so its selections and estimate, change; a `param_info` with
  no unknown range, a data-frame `grid`, a `nested_cv()` design, and an
  outer split that repeats a row are unaffected, and `nested_tune_grid()` on the two designs built under one
  seed now returns identical `.inner_metrics` and `.metrics`. This applies to
  `nested_tune_grid()`, both racing functions and `nested_tune_sim_anneal()`;
  `nested_tune_bayes()` refuses an unknown range before any frame is read,
  as before. `nested_final_fit()` still finalizes on the full data, which is
  the final model's own training data. The design object does not change; a
  running fold holds one copy of its analysis set for the tuning call.

* `nested_final_fit()` refuses a results object in which no outer fold
  completed, with condition class `nestedtune_no_completed_folds`: such a run
  has no estimate to report a model with, and the message points at
  `summary()` on the object, which lists the stage each fold failed at. The
  refusal comes after the three `nestedtune_bad_results` refusals and before
  anything is fitted or drawn. `collect_metrics()`, `autoplot()` and
  `agreement()` already refused the same object; their error now carries the
  same class, so the fact is catchable one way at every door. A run in which
  some folds failed is fitted as before.

* `nested_tune_sim_anneal()` runs the outer loop of nested cross-validation
  with finetune's simulated annealing inside: each outer fold scores
  `initial` space-filling candidates on its inner resamples, then for `iter`
  iterations perturbs the current candidate and keeps or discards the result
  by finetune's annealing rule. It is `nested_tune_bayes()`'s sibling: the
  same arguments less `objective`, `initial` defaulting to 1 (finetune's
  default; at least 1 rather than the Bayesian sibling's 2), and a
  `finetune::control_sim_anneal()` through `...` as `control`. Each fold's
  `.inner_metrics` carries `.iter`, `0` on the initial candidates. Refused
  at entry, before any fold runs: finetune not installed
  (`nestedtune_pkg_not_installed`); `iter` below 1 (`nestedtune_bad_iter`)
  -- finetune 1.3.0 runs two iterations at `iter = 0`, not none, so the 0
  the Bayesian sibling accepts is refused here; `initial` below 1 or a
  `tune_results` (`nestedtune_bad_initial`); a control that is not a
  `control_sim_anneal()` (`nestedtune_bad_control`). `control_sim_anneal()`
  defaults `verbose_iter` to `TRUE`, which prints finetune's annealing log
  from every fold of a serial run; pass `control =
  control_sim_anneal(verbose_iter = FALSE)` for a quiet run.
  `nested_final_fit()` on an annealing result runs the search again on the
  full data and prints the initial and iteration counts that ran beside the
  ones requested, as it does for a Bayesian result (#35).

* `nested_tune_race_anova()` and `nested_tune_race_win_loss()` run the outer
  loop of nested cross-validation with finetune's two racing tuners inside:
  each outer fold scores every candidate in `grid` on `burn_in` inner
  resamples (shuffled first under `control_race()`'s default `randomize =
  TRUE`), drops the candidates already clearly worse than the best, and
  scores the survivors on the rest. They take `nested_tune_grid()`'s
  arguments, and a `finetune::control_race()` through `...` as `control`.
  Each fold's `.inner_metrics` holds every candidate its race scored,
  eliminated candidates included (`tune::collect_metrics(<race>, all_configs
  = TRUE)`), with `n` the number of inner resamples each was scored on;
  `attr(x, "grid")` and the `procedure` record hold the grid as offered.
  Refused at entry, before any fold runs: finetune not installed, lme4 (for
  the ANOVA race) or BradleyTerry2 (for the win/loss race) not installed
  (`nestedtune_pkg_not_installed`); a control that is not a `control_race()`
  (`nestedtune_bad_control`); and an inner design in any outer fold with no
  more resamples than the control's `burn_in` (`nestedtune_bad_burn_in`) --
  `control_race()` defaults `burn_in` to 3, so a design with three inner
  resamples needs `control = control_race(burn_in = 2)`. `nested_final_fit()`
  on a racing result races the recorded grid again on the full data, and
  `extract_scored_candidates()` on that fit lists every candidate the race
  scored. finetune, lme4 and BradleyTerry2 join Suggests (#35).

* Breaking: each outer fold of a `nested_results` now carries its inner
  tuning run's metrics as `.inner_metrics` -- `tune::collect_metrics()` of
  that fold's run, one row per candidate and metric with `.metric`,
  `.estimator`, `mean`, `n`, `std_err` and `.config`, plus `.iter` from
  `nested_tune_bayes()` -- in
  place of the `.grid` column, which held the candidates alone. The
  candidates a fold searched are the table's distinct parameter rows, so
  nothing `.grid` recorded is lost, and a Bayesian search's trajectory or a
  fold's best candidate can now be computed from the object. A fold that
  tuned and then failed its outer fit keeps its table; a fold that scored
  nothing carries a zero-row table under a completed fold's columns. The
  column is part of the record the dplyr and vctrs invariants check, as
  `.grid` was. `.selected` is unchanged. `extract_scored_candidates()` on a
  `nested_final_fit` keeps its candidate columns and `.config`, and no longer
  carries `.eval_time` on a fit that scored a dynamic survival metric -- the
  column held one arbitrary evaluation time per candidate; the times are in
  `collect_metrics(extract_tune_results(x))` (#57).

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_tune_bayes()` now take a control object
  through `...` -- `control = tune::control_grid(...)` on the first,
  `control = tune::control_bayes(...)` on the second -- and pass it to the
  inner tuning call in every fold; `nested_final_fit()` re-runs under the
  control the result recorded, `attr(res, "procedure")$control`. The slots
  this package forces are overwritten rather than refused: `allow_par` is
  `FALSE`, and the Bayesian `seed` is each fold's tuning seed, so a control
  setting either yields the run the default gives. `event_level` stays an
  argument, and a control naming a level that is neither tune's default nor
  the argument's is refused at entry, as is a control that is not what the
  matching `tune::control_*()` returns (condition class
  `nestedtune_bad_control`) and any other name or an unnamed value in `...`
  (`nestedtune_bad_dots`). `no_improve`, `uncertain` and `time_limit` reach
  `tune::tune_bayes()` this way. Each help page now classifies every slot of
  its control object under one of six headings: forced, settable as its own
  argument, refused, passed through, not returned, inert (#33, #35).

* Breaking: `nested_final_fit()` now takes the `nested_results` object in
  place of the design and the procedure -- `nested_final_fit(object,
  results)` -- and re-runs the procedure that result recorded: the design's
  inner resampling specification, now carried on every `nested_results` as
  its `inside` attribute, the tuner and its arguments from the `procedure`
  attribute, the metric set, and the data every split references. The
  former `grid`, `param_info`, `metrics`, `event_level` and `eval_time`
  arguments are gone, so the model and the estimate you report for it come
  from one search by construction; a Bayesian result re-runs
  `tune::tune_bayes()` with its Gaussian process seeded from the fit's
  tuning seed, exactly as each outer fold was. A results object with no such
  record (built by an earlier version, or from a design assembled by hand),
  one that is no longer a `nested_results` (an operation that changed the
  rows returns a plain tibble), or one with no rows is refused before any
  fitting, with condition class `nestedtune_bad_results`. Not migrated.

* `predict()` and `augment()` now work directly on a `nested_final_fit`,
  returning what the same call on `extract_workflow(final)` returns; the
  `extract_workflow()` route still works. `augment` is re-exported so the
  call needs no other package attached. `predict()` passes further arguments
  (`level`, `eval_time`, ...) through to the model, where parsnip refuses
  a name it does not recognise; `augment()` takes `new_data` and `eval_time` only
  and refuses anything else, where workflows' own method would let it
  vanish. The help page says what residuals on the training rows are not.

* `print()` and `summary()` on a `nested_final_fit` name the procedure that
  ran: the candidates scored for a grid search; for a Bayesian search the
  initial candidates and iterations, each as what ran beside what was
  requested. The summary carries those counts as components, `NULL` on a
  grid fit, and a `tuner` component; the printed pointer to the estimate now
  names the results object the fit was built from rather than one
  orchestrator. The object gains a `procedure` element, and
  `extract_scored_candidates()` on a Bayesian final fit carries `.iter`.

* `nested_tune_bayes()` runs the outer loop of nested cross-validation with
  `tune::tune_bayes()` as the inner tuner. On each outer fold it scores
  `initial` space-filling candidates on the fold's inner resamples, lets a
  Gaussian process propose up to `iter` more under `objective`, selects the
  best,
  and fits and scores the outer split -- what `nested_tune_grid()` does around
  `tune::tune_grid()`, through the same loop, so the seed contract, the
  parallel path, the results object and its methods are shared. Two rules are
  its own. The Gaussian process is seeded from the fold's tuning seed, so a
  fold reproduces from its `.tuning_seed` alone, and `iter = 0` gives the
  numbers `nested_tune_grid()` gives on the same space-filling grid. And
  `initial` is a count only: a `tune_results` object, which tune accepts
  there, is refused, since one tuning run cannot serve every outer fold.
  `iter`, `initial` and `objective` are refused at entry, each with its own
  condition class, unless a single non-negative whole number, a single whole
  number of at least 2, and an acquisition function.

* Each fold's `.grid` from `nested_tune_bayes()` carries an `.iter` column
  naming the search iteration each candidate was proposed in, `0` for the
  initial candidates. The candidates-searched line `print()` shows and the
  candidate counts `summary()` holds count those rows.

* Every `nested_results`, from either orchestrator, carries a `procedure`
  attribute: a named list of the tuner that ran (`"tune_grid"` or
  `"tune_bayes"`), its own arguments (`grid`, or `iter`, `initial` and
  `objective`), and `param_info`, `event_level` and `eval_time`. It travels
  with the class through the dplyr and vctrs doors and is shed with it. A
  Bayesian result has no `grid` attribute. The `grid` and `metrics`
  attributes of a grid result are as they were.

* `agreement()` reports how often each candidate was selected across the
  outer folds of a `nested_results`: one row per distinct combination of
  selected parameter values, with `n`, the number of completed outer folds that
  chose it, and `prop`, that count over the completed fold count, most frequent
  first. A fold with no recorded value for a parameter is counted under `NA`,
  and a partial run is tabulated over the folds that completed, with a warning
  saying so. The most frequent combination is not the final model's
  parameters; `nested_final_fit()` selects those for itself.

* `print()` on a `nested_results` accepts `n` and `width` and passes them to
  the rendering of the outer-fold rows, so `print(res, n = Inf)` shows every
  fold of a run of more than twenty and `print(res, width = 40)` narrows the
  table.
  Both are matched by full name only; any other argument is still refused.
  Previously `print(res, n = 25)` was an error.

* The failure advice a `nested_results` summary prints now names the results
  object's `.notes` column. Previously it read `x$.notes`, and `x` inside the
  summary's print method is the summary itself, which has no such column.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` gain an `eval_time` argument,
  passed on to every `tune` call whose answer depends on it, so a censored
  regression workflow scored by a dynamic or integrated survival metric is
  measured at the times you name rather than at whatever tune picks. It is
  refused ahead of tune when it is not numeric, is empty, or has an element
  that is missing, negative or not finite; zero, repeated times and times out
  of order are passed on untouched for tune to normalize. A metric measured at
  several evaluation times is summarized per time by `collect_metrics()` and
  `summary()`, each row naming its time in a `.eval_time` column, and drawn
  one panel per time by `autoplot(type = "performance")`, so estimates at
  different times are never averaged together; a run scored by no survival
  metric keeps the columns it had. Previously neither function took the
  argument and neither could reach it.

* `summary()` on a `nested_final_fit` returns a `summary.nested_final_fit`
  object holding the full-data tuning run's resampling scheme, the number of
  candidates that run scored, the parameter values selection chose, and an
  `estimate` component that is always `NULL` — so a caller can reach a value
  without re-deriving it from the fit. Printing it
  reports those under headings and says, where the number would be, that this
  model has no performance estimate of its own and that the nested estimate is
  the one to report. Previously `summary()` on a final fit fell through to the
  default method and printed a table of the object's five internal components.
  `print()` on a final fit is unchanged.

* Breaking: printing a `nested_results` now shows the object — its outer folds
  as the tibble rows they are, the resampling scheme it came from, a count of
  the folds that did not complete, and a note when the folds did not all search
  the same grid. Everything else printing used to report has moved behind
  `summary()`: which folds failed and at which stage, what each fold's inner
  tuning selected, the estimate across the folds that completed, and the
  sentence saying a nested estimate describes the procedure rather than a model
  you can deploy. Previously `print()` reported all of that and never showed a
  single row of the object.

* `summary()` on a `nested_results` returns a `summary.nested_results` object
  holding the requested and completed fold counts, the failed folds with the
  stage each failed at, the values the completed folds selected for each tuned
  parameter, and the metric estimates averaged across them — so a caller can
  reach a number without re-deriving it from the columns. Summarizing a run
  that only partly completed warns and still returns the summary; summarizing
  one where every fold failed does the same, where `collect_metrics()` refuses
  outright.

* A `nested_results` whose record of its fold-label columns cannot label its
  rows — because the record is empty, or names a column the object no longer
  carries — now names each fold by its row position. Previously the first two
  cases made printing raise, and a record naming several columns of which some
  were absent produced a truncated label such as `Fold1, `.

* Breaking: an operation that changes which outer folds a `nested_results`
  holds now returns a plain tibble instead of a `nested_results`. `slice()`,
  `head()`, `x[1, ]`, `x[-1, ]`, a `filter()` that drops a failed fold and
  `bind_rows()` all take this branch, and so does dropping any of the columns
  the run is recorded in. Previously `dplyr::slice(x, 1)` returned a one-row
  object still headed `Outer resamples: 3-fold cross-validation` and still
  reporting three outer folds attempted, and `x[1, ]` returned a one-row
  object that went on claiming to be a results object.

  Operations that leave the set of folds alone keep the class and the run's
  record: reordering rows with `arrange()`, adding a column with `mutate()` or
  `bind_cols()`, reordering columns with `relocate()`, and a `left_join()` that
  matches one row apiece. These are the invariants `tune` declares on its own
  results objects.

* Breaking: the same rule now covers the vctrs verbs and base `rbind()`.
  `vctrs::vec_slice(x, 1)`, `vctrs::vec_rbind(x, x)`, `vctrs::vec_c(x, x)` and
  `rbind(x, x)` each return a plain tibble. Previously all four handed back an
  object still carrying the class and still reporting the fold counts of the
  object it was built from — `rbind(x, x)` gave six rows still headed as a
  3-fold run. Reordering rows with `vctrs::vec_slice(x, c(2, 1, 3))` keeps the
  class, and so does adding a column with `vctrs::vec_cbind()`, which now
  answers exactly as `dplyr::bind_cols()` does. Both build on the first
  argument's type, so `vec_cbind(x, extra)` and `bind_cols(x, extra)` keep the
  class while `vec_cbind(extra, x)` and `bind_cols(extra, x)` return plain
  tibbles holding the same columns. `vctrs::vec_rbind()` and `vctrs::vec_c()`
  return a plain tibble even when given one argument and nothing to combine it
  with, where `dplyr::bind_rows(x)` keeps the class.

* Breaking: `dplyr::rename()` moving one of the columns the run is recorded in
  now returns a plain tibble. Previously it returned a `nested_results` that no
  longer had that column: `rename()` renames through `names<-`, which reaches
  neither dplyr's reconstruction nor vctrs'.

* `vctrs` is now a hard dependency. It was already installed alongside
  nestedtune, since `dplyr` requires it.

* `dplyr` is now a hard dependency. It was already installed alongside
  nestedtune, since `tune` requires it.

* Fixed fold labels in `collect_metrics(summarize = FALSE)` and in the
  partial-run warning, and the rule that decides whether an operation keeps the
  `nested_results` class. Both worked out an object's fold-label columns from
  its column names, so a column you added was treated as one of the design's
  whenever its name looked like one. Adding `id_extra` reported the folds as
  `Fold1, x` rather than `Fold1`; adding `id2` to a result from a plain v-fold
  design and then removing it again returned a plain tibble, where the same
  round trip on `extra` did not; and adding a list column named `id0` to a
  result from a repeated design failed with `unimplemented type 'list' in
  'listgreater'`. A results object now records the columns its resampling
  design labelled the folds with, so a column you add is read as a fold label
  only when the design itself carries a column of that name.

* Fixed an error from replacing a fold-label column with a value that cannot be
  ordered. `dplyr::mutate(x, id = list(c(1, 2), 3, 4))` failed with
  `unimplemented type 'list' in 'orderVector1'`, raised from inside the rule
  and naming nothing the caller had done. It returns a plain tibble now, which
  is what replacing a column the run is recorded in has always meant.

* Fixed a failure where every outer fold errored under parallel processing if
  the workflow's recipe used unqualified selectors such as
  `all_numeric_predictors()`. The packages a workflow declares are now attached
  inside each `mirai` daemon before any fold is dispatched, so a selector that
  resolves from your own attached packages resolves on a worker too. The same
  call ran without error when no daemons were running, which is what made the
  failure look like a parallel-only quirk.

* Breaking: `nested_tune_grid()`, `nested_final_fit()` and `nested_resamples()`
  now take `...` immediately after their required arguments, so `grid`,
  `metrics` and `param_info` must be named. A call that passed them by position
  needs updating, and so does one that abbreviated a name: R does not
  partial-match an argument that follows `...`, so `metrics` can no longer be
  written `met`. In exchange, a mistyped or unsupported argument is now an
  error naming the function it was passed to, instead of being ignored. Every
  method the package registers whose `...` is documented as unused refuses an
  argument the same way.

* Breaking: `collect_metrics()` on a `nested_results` object takes `summarize`
  after `...`, matching tune's own method, so it must be named.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` gain `param_info`, passed
  unchanged to `tune::tune_grid()` — on every outer fold and on the parallel
  path as well as the serial one. Restricting a parameter's range restricts the
  grid every fold searches. A `param_info` that is not a `dials::parameters()`
  object is refused before the first fold is fitted.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` gain `event_level`, naming
  which level of a two-class outcome factor counts as the event. It reaches the
  inner tuning run on both functions, and on `nested_tune_grid()` the outer
  scoring fit as well, which the package sent no settings to before — so a
  reported `sens` or `spec` was computed against the first level whatever the
  inner run had been told. Metrics that do not distinguish the two levels, such
  as `roc_auc` and `accuracy`, are unaffected. A value that is not `"first"` or
  `"second"` is refused before the first fold is fitted.

* The documentation site now builds with the tidymodels organization's shared
  pkgdown theme, and the organization's contributing guide and code of conduct
  have joined the repository and build as pages of the site. The README says on
  its face that the interface is experimental.

* The package has moved to the tidymodels organization. It now lives at
  <https://github.com/tidymodels/nestedtune>, its documentation site is served
  at <https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/>, and `DESCRIPTION`, the README badges
  and the installation instructions name those addresses. The old repository
  address redirects to the new one; the old documentation address does not, so
  a bookmark of the site needs updating.

* The documentation now names the quantity a nested run estimates, instead of
  describing it. `collect_metrics()` estimates the k-fold test error of the
  whole tune-and-fit procedure on the analysis sets the outer folds drew —
  which is neither the risk of the model you deploy nor the same quantity
  averaged over datasets, and the help page and the guide both say so.

* `collect_metrics()` help now explains why its `std_err` column is not a
  confidence interval and why no interval is offered: outer fold scores share
  most of their training rows, so a standard error computed as though they were
  independent can misstate the uncertainty, typically downward, and there is no
  universally unbiased replacement to substitute. Published measurements of what
  that costs are cited.

* The nested cross-validation guide gains sources for its claim that the
  estimate runs slightly pessimistic, a warning against reading a gap between
  two nested estimates as a result, an explanation of why folds disagreeing
  about a parameter is expected rather than alarming, and a new section on when
  nesting is worth its cost and when it is not.

* A parallel run now refuses to start when a worker is holding an older install
  of nestedtune, instead of failing every fold with an opaque error. Workers are
  separate R processes, and the outer loop reaches into each one's own copy of
  the package by name — so a worker whose copy predates a function the loop
  needs loads the package quite happily and then dies on every fold. The startup
  check now asks each worker which of this session's internal functions its copy
  is missing, and the error names them, along with the fix: reinstall, then
  restart the pool. The restart matters — a running worker keeps the version it
  has already loaded, so reinstalling underneath one changes nothing.

* A parallel run started on a worker pool that cannot be cancelled now says so,
  once, at the start of the run. `mirai::daemons(n)` gives you a pool that stops
  when you interrupt; `mirai::daemons(n, dispatcher = FALSE)` gives you one that
  does not, and the two are indistinguishable from the outside. On the second
  kind, interrupting a run hands you back your prompt while the outer folds
  carry on computing results nobody will read. Previously only the documentation
  mentioned this. The pool is not refused — its results are correct, and only
  the ability to stop it is missing — so this is a warning, of class
  `nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable`.

* Running the outer folds in parallel now sends each fold one copy of your data
  instead of one copy per inner resample. A split carries the whole frame it
  indexes, and sending a fold to a worker serializes it, which does not preserve
  the single shared copy the design holds in memory — so a design with five
  inner resamples was putting six copies of the data on the wire for every outer
  fold. The splits are now emptied before dispatch and refilled on the worker.
  On a five-fold design over a 5,000-row frame this took a run from 25.7 MB to
  4.7 MB. Results are unchanged: the objects each fold receives are identical to
  the ones a serial run passes, and the serial path is untouched.

* The object `nested_final_fit()` returns now has two named accessors for the
  tuning run behind it. `extract_tune_results()` returns that run — the record
  of what parameter selection actually saw when the procedure was re-run on
  your whole dataset — and `extract_scored_candidates()` returns the candidate
  settings it scored, in the same shape as the per-fold `.grid` tables on a
  `nested_tune_grid()` result, so the two can be compared directly. Both were
  reachable before only by reaching into the object's internals. Note what the
  first one's numbers are worth: every metric inside that tuning run was
  computed on the resamples that chose the candidate it describes, so it
  flatters this model and is not its performance. The nested estimate from
  `collect_metrics()` on the `nested_tune_grid()` result remains the number to
  report. Handing either accessor an object it cannot answer for — a
  `nested_tune_grid()` result, say — now produces an error saying so, rather
  than R's bare "no applicable method".

* `nested_tune_grid()` results now record which parameter candidates each outer
  fold actually searched, in a new `.grid` column holding one table per fold.
  Until now the object recorded only the grid you *asked* for, and the two are
  routinely different: a grid size is expanded by tune and can reach fewer
  candidates than you requested — asking for 20 on a parameter with four
  reachable values searches four — and a candidate that fails scores nothing.
  Folds can also differ from each other, because expanding a size draws from
  the random number generator and each fold is seeded separately, so tuning a
  continuous parameter with `grid = 10` leaves every fold searching its own
  candidates. Printing a result now says so when it happens, reporting each
  fold's candidate count, which matters when you are reading the per-fold
  selections: folds that disagree may not have been choosing from the same set.
  A fold that failed keeps whatever it managed to score, and one that scored
  nothing carries an empty table. A candidate that failed on every inner
  resample is absent from `.grid` and recorded in `.notes` instead — tune keeps
  no other record of it.

* The object `nested_tune_grid()` returns now documents the two attributes it
  has always carried. `attr(x, "grid")` and `attr(x, "metrics")` record what
  the run was asked to do: `grid` holds the argument as you gave it, so it is
  a grid size rather than a table of candidates whenever you passed a size,
  and it is not a record of which candidates were evaluated; `metrics` is
  absent rather than `NULL` when you passed no metric set. Subsetting rows
  leaves both unchanged.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` now refuse a malformed design
  before fitting anything, naming the column and the position of the first
  offending element. A design whose `splits` or `inner_resamples` column held
  something other than a split or a resampling object used to cost a full run
  and come back reporting that every outer fold had failed — or, on
  `nested_final_fit()`, fail with a message from base R that named nothing you
  wrote. `rsample::nested_cv()` builds such a design without complaint when its
  `inside` argument produces no `rset`, which is the usual way to arrive at one.
  A design either function refuses, both refuse.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` now also refuse a workflow that
  has a model but no preprocessor, pointing at `workflows::add_formula()`,
  `add_recipe()`, and `add_variables()`. This is the counterpart of the
  no-model refusal below, and it used to fail once per outer fold with an error
  raised inside `workflows`.

* When `nested_final_fit()` cannot re-run a design's stored inner
  specification, the error now names your call rather than an internal
  function of the package.

* `nested_resamples()` now refuses an `inside` specification that does not
  produce an `rset`. Passing one used to build a design anyway: its
  `inner_resamples` column held whatever the specification returned, nothing
  complained, and the first sign of trouble was an error from deep inside R the
  next time the design was printed or used.

* When a resampling specification fails to evaluate, the error now names the
  specification that was tried instead of deparsing your data into the message.
  Both `outside` and `inside` had the data frame written into the call being
  evaluated, so a failure on a small 30×2 frame already produced around 1,200
  characters that were mostly your own numbers, growing from there — long enough
  to bury the actual problem. Such a failure is now also wrapped in a
  nestedtune error carrying the original as its cause, so code matching on the
  underlying package's condition class or on the whole message string sees a
  different condition than before.

* `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` now say for themselves that a
  workflow has no model in it, and point at `workflows::add_model()`. A
  workflow carrying only a preprocessor — the easiest one to build by accident
  — used to fail with an error raised inside `workflows`, naming a call you
  never wrote, while every other bad `object` named yours. An entirely empty
  workflow is refused the same way and says which of the two it is.

* The documentation website now actually publishes. The job that pushes the
  built site had no copy of the repository to work in, so the first build to
  reach the default branch failed at the publishing step and no site was ever
  served.

* The reference pages and `vignette("nested-cv")` are now built into a
  documentation website, rebuilt whenever a change lands on the default branch
  that the package itself can see. `DESCRIPTION` and the README have pointed
  at a documentation site since the guide was added; it goes live once GitHub
  Pages is switched on for the repository.

* Interrupting a parallel run now asks the folds it had already sent to the
  workers to stop. Before, the interrupt gave you your prompt back but left
  those folds computing — work whose results nobody would ever read, on the
  very pool you were about to reuse, until it finished on its own. However the
  call is left once its folds are dispatched, the outstanding ones are now
  cancelled on the way out and the pool goes idle shortly after. Two limits:
  cancelling needs mirai's dispatcher, which `mirai::daemons(n)` starts by
  default and `mirai::daemons(n, dispatcher = FALSE)` does not, so on such a
  pool the folds still run to completion; and a fold already inside a compiled
  fitting routine may not be interruptible.

* The check that runs before parallel dispatch now asks every connected daemon
  whether it can load the package, instead of asking one and believing it for
  all of them. In a pool whose daemons differ — one respawned, or started
  against a different library — a single loadable daemon used to pass the check
  for the whole pool, and every fold that ran elsewhere came back as an opaque
  worker failure. The check now names how many daemons are affected and stops.

* A daemon that does not answer that check is now reported as a non-response
  rather than as one that cannot load the package, so a merely slow daemon is no
  longer met with advice to install what you already have. The two failures
  raise `nestedtune_daemons_cannot_load` and `nestedtune_daemons_no_response`;
  both also carry `nestedtune_daemons_unusable`, so a handler that only cares
  that the check failed can catch either, and code already handling the former
  keeps working unchanged.

* The wait for that check, previously fixed at 30 seconds, is now settable with
  `options(nestedtune.preflight_timeout = <milliseconds>)`. The default is
  unchanged, and no statistical result depends on it. It must be a single
  positive, finite number — an unbounded wait would restore the hang the bound
  exists to turn into an error.

* One consequence worth knowing: because the check now waits for every daemon
  rather than whichever answers first, the first parallel call after starting a
  cold pool is the slow one — it is what makes each daemon load the package,
  and on a loaded machine that can exceed the default 30 seconds. Raise the
  option if you meet a non-response you do not believe. Later calls in the same
  session reuse what the daemons already loaded.

* Cancelling a parallel run now stops it, instead of returning an estimate over
  whatever had finished. Previously the tasks that were stopped before they ran
  came back looking like folds that had been attempted and failed, so the run
  completed and reported a number for a design that never executed. It now
  raises a `nestedtune_cancelled` condition and returns nothing, with your RNG
  state restored. That condition inherits from `nestedtune_interrupted`, so code
  already handling a stopped run keeps working unchanged.

* One case is deliberately left as it was, and is now documented: calling
  `mirai::daemons(0)` while folds are still outstanding produces exactly what a
  worker dying mid-fold produces, with nothing to tell the two apart. It stays
  recorded as fold failures, because treating it as a cancellation would throw
  away every completed fold whenever a single worker died.

* `autoplot()` now draws a nested cross-validation result. Its default view puts
  one point per outer fold at the value that fold's inner tuning selected, one
  panel per tuned parameter: a flat row means the folds agreed, and scatter means
  they disagreed and the value your deployed model carries was largely arbitrary.
  Printing has said this in words since the last release; now you can see it.

* `autoplot(x, type = "performance")` draws each outer fold's score with a dashed
  line at the nested estimate. That line is the number `collect_metrics()`
  reports, read from the same place rather than recomputed, so the figure and the
  summary cannot disagree. Its subtitle says the estimate describes the
  tune-and-fit procedure rather than a model you can deploy, so the caveat
  travels with a figure exported into a slide or a paper.

* Both views keep every outer fold that was *attempted* on the axis. A fold that
  failed, or one that completed without recording a value for a parameter, leaves
  a visible gap rather than being quietly dropped or drawn at an invented value.

* The subtitle says how much of the requested design ran, and each panel says
  when fewer folds contributed to it than completed — `mtry (2 of 3 chose)`,
  `rmse (from 2 folds)`. Counting per panel rather than per figure is what keeps
  the claim true: a parameter only some folds chose a value for would otherwise
  read as unanimity, and a metric one fold could not score would read as an
  estimate from more folds than it had. A metric no completed fold could score
  keeps an empty panel rather than vanishing from the figure.

* `ggplot2` is now a hard dependency. Plotting a run where no outer fold
  completed, or asking for the parameters view of a design with no tuned
  parameters, is refused with a message saying which it was.

* `nested_tune_grid()` now runs its outer folds in parallel. Start workers with
  `mirai::daemons(n)` before the call and the loop uses them; there is no
  argument to set, and no daemons means the serial behaviour is unchanged.
  Inner tuning still runs serially, because nesting parallelism inside
  parallelism oversubscribes cores.

* Parallel results are identical to serial ones. The same seed gives the same
  answer at any number of workers, because each fold's seeds are drawn before
  the loop starts and assigned by position — a fold's result depends on where it
  sits in the design, never on which worker ran it. A fold whose worker dies is
  recorded as a failed fold like any other, and the run finishes.

* `?nested_tune_grid` gains a "Parallel execution" section covering what workers
  do and do not inherit from your session, and why the package must be installed
  where they can load it.

* A new guide, `vignette("nested-cv")`, runs the whole path — build a nested
  design, run the loop, read what each fold selected, fit the model to deploy —
  as code you can run, and says plainly what to report for that model and why.
  It puts the nested estimate next to the selection-time score users are most
  tempted to report, and closes with a worked write-up. Every number in its
  prose is produced when the vignette is built, so a claim that stops being true
  fails the check rather than ageing quietly.

* New `nested_final_fit()` builds the model you actually deploy. It runs the
  same tuning procedure the nested estimate describes, this time with the whole
  dataset in hand: it re-evaluates the design's inner resampling specification
  against every row, tunes, selects, and fits. Reach the trained workflow with
  `extract_workflow()`.

* The final model is a separate object rather than a field on the results, and
  it carries no performance number of its own. Report the estimate from
  `collect_metrics()` on the `nested_tune_grid()` result for it — the
  documentation says why, and what that number does and does not claim.
  `collect_metrics()`, `show_best()`, and `select_best()` deliberately refuse a
  final fit rather than returning something that reads as its score.

* Because the inner resampling specification is stored unevaluated and
  re-evaluated at final-fit time, write it with literal arguments —
  `inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)`, not `inside = vfold_cv(v = k)`. A specification
  whose variables have gone out of scope now fails with a message naming it.

* Nested results now print as a report on the run rather than as a table of
  list columns. It names the outer resampling scheme, says how many folds were
  requested and how many completed, names any fold that failed along with the
  stage it failed at, and gives the estimate across the folds that contributed.

* Printing shows what each outer fold's inner tuning selected, marking whether
  the folds agreed on a parameter or disagreed about it and, when they
  disagreed, listing every fold's choice. Disagreement means the tuning
  procedure is unstable on this data, which averaging the metrics would hide.

* Printing also states plainly that the estimate describes the tune-and-fit
  procedure rather than a model you can deploy — the caveat now travels with
  the number instead of living only in the documentation.

* Printing never warns and never errors, including for a run where no outer
  fold completed at all. `collect_metrics()` still does both: asking for a
  summary of a design that did not run deserves a condition, while describing
  an object does not.

* An outer fold that fails no longer ends the run. The remaining folds still
  run, and the failed one is recorded rather than thrown away: `.completed`
  marks it, and `.notes` says which stage failed and why, carrying tune's own
  notes about the underlying cause. This matters because both stages can fail
  quietly — inner tuning only raises once every candidate has failed, and the
  outer fit does not raise at all.

* A fold that completes on only part of its inner design now keeps the notes
  explaining what was lost. `.completed` being `TRUE` alongside a non-empty
  `.notes` means the fold worked, but chose its parameters on less of the inner
  design than was requested.

* `nested_tune_grid()` now checks a data-frame `grid` against the workflow
  before fitting anything: a column that is not marked for tuning, or a tuned
  parameter with no column, is refused immediately and by name. Either mistake
  is wrong for every fold rather than for one, so it is reported as what it is
  — an error in the call — instead of as an entire design failing.

* `collect_metrics()` now summarizes only the outer folds that completed, warns
  naming the ones that did not, and errors rather than returning `NA` when none
  completed. An estimate is never reported as though it came from a design that
  did not run.

* Added `nested_tune_grid()`, which runs the nested cross-validation loop end to
  end. For each outer fold it tunes on that fold's inner resamples with
  `tune::tune_grid()`, selects the best candidate, finalizes the workflow, and
  fits and scores it on the outer split. The result keeps each fold's chosen
  parameters alongside its metrics, so disagreement between folds — selection
  instability — is visible rather than averaged away.

* Added a `collect_metrics()` method for those results, returning either the
  per-fold metrics or their summary across outer folds.

* `nested_tune_grid()` is reproducible from a single `set.seed()` before the
  call. It derives one tuning seed and one outer-fit seed per fold up front, so
  a fold's result depends on its position in the design rather than on the order
  folds happen to run in, and it leaves the caller's random-number state exactly
  as it found it.

* Added `nested_resamples()`, a constructor for nested resampling designs that
  does not keep a copy of the data for every outer fold. For the same seed and
  the same specifications it selects the same rows as `rsample::nested_cv()`:
  `analysis()` and `assessment()` return identical frames, and each inner split
  carries the same class and resample id. On a 20000-row dataset with a
  five-fold inner resampling, a 50-fold outer design holds 10× the source data
  rather than 57×.

* `nested_resamples()` refuses an outer bootstrap rather than warning about it.
  The same observation can otherwise land in both the inner analysis and the
  inner assessment set, which makes the design invalid rather than unusual.
