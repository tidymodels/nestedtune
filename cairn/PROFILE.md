# Toolchain profile: r-package

<!-- A cairn *toolchain profile*: the language-specific slots the operational skills read. The Validation
     doctrine is universal, not a slot (skills/shared/validation-doctrine.md); all seven slots must be non-empty — cairn_validate FAILs on a missing or empty slot. -->

The R-package toolchain: devtools/roxygen/testthat/pkgdown, CRAN release.

## verify
Run by `/milestone-implement` (per task) and `/hotfix` (gate-lite):
- After roxygen changes: `Rscript -e 'devtools::document()'`.
- After code changes, before a task is checked off: `Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'` clean.
- `/hotfix` gate-lite: `devtools::test()` clean; `devtools::document()` if
  roxygen changed; `devtools::check()` if anything structural was touched.

## consistency-gate
Toolchain checks `/milestone-review` runs *in addition to* the universal
cairn-file checks (`cairn_validate`, coverage completeness, `cairn_impact`):
- `devtools::document()` produces no diff.
- Generated files are never hand-edited: `NAMESPACE`, `man/`, and `data/*.rda`
  regenerate from roxygen and `data-raw/` scripts (the no-diff `document()`
  check catches drift).
- README.md is knitted from README.Rmd; present and out of sync with README.md → `devtools::build_readme()`, commit.
- pkgdown site present → `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()` passes (catches exports missing from `_pkgdown.yml`).
- The declared changelog (`## changelog` slot) has an entry for this milestone's user-visible changes (no milestone numbers in user-facing text).
- New top-level files have `.Rbuildignore` entries (check `check()` NOTEs).
- Full check at review: `Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings; justify NOTEs).

## test-doctrine
R-mechanical test expectations layered on the universal "What gets a test"
rules in tracking-rules:
- Tests are written for `testthat` edition 3 (3e).
- Every exported function: happy path, every `cli_abort()` branch fired, R
  edge cases — zero rows, `NA`, length-one, factor vs. character, empty strings.
- New user-facing conditions use `cli::cli_abort()` / rlang, not assertthat.
- Indirect by default: internal helpers (direct tests only for independent logic).
- Never test print cosmetics beyond meaningful snapshots, trivial pass-throughs,
  dependency behavior, or plots except `vdiffr` when the plot is the product.
- `covr` is a diagnostic, never a gate.
- CI starts from the usethis pair: `check-standard` runs `R CMD check` across
  platforms (a normal CI check — see the merge clause below), `test-coverage` runs
  `covr` to Codecov, annotating a PR but never gating it; `.github/` is `.Rbuildignore`d.
- Six divergences from that stock shape (M11 ×2, M12 rev. M31, M14, M33, M52). **A `concurrency` block**
  cancels a superseded run on every ref but the default branch, a distribution channel that keeps a completed
  check instead. **A `paths-ignore` filter** on both triggers of both gating workflows skips `cairn/**`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/**`, which cannot change what `R CMD check` sees — that is the test a fourth path must
  meet; it bites on `push` only, GitHub evaluating it on a `pull_request` against the whole PR diff. **Hang
  caps at two scopes** turn a hang into a failed job with a timestamp: `R-CMD-check` bounds its job at 60
  minutes and its `check-r-package` step at 30 (40 on the devel leg since M72, whose tests pushed a step already
  at 28.5 minutes past 30), `test-coverage` its job at 20, `R-CMD-check-hard` its job at 30 (M57; its yaml says
  why one scope); re-read them with `grep -n timeout-minutes .github/workflows/*.yaml`.
  The step bound is the guarantee, on the code both hangs were in (`test_check("nestedtune")`, 52 min under `R
  CMD check` and 40 under `covr`, hence the two scopes). It was 20 until M48 (2026-09-02) saw the windows step
  killed at 20 three runs in a row; 30 is not free headroom, and a leg nearing it is a suite to make faster
  (M52). 60 is the devel leg's from-source build of 129 dependencies, which a 20-minute job cap killed before
  cache-save; it leaves every non-check step bounded only by the job.
  **Parallel test files** (`Config/testthat/parallel: true`, M52): `Config/testthat/start-first` in
  DESCRIPTION queues the slowest files first, so the run is bounded by the largest file rather than by
  whatever lands last; the worker count is `TESTTHAT_CPUS` (testthat prefers `getOption("Ncpus")` when set; no `.Rprofile` sets it), set in the three check workflows' job `env:` at one
  per runner core (4 on ubuntu and windows, 3 on macOS) and left at testthat's default of 2 locally;
  `benchmarks/profile-tests.R` pins itself serial so its per-file figures stay comparable. **A
  `workflow_dispatch`-only stress workflow** (`stress-daemon-tests.yaml`) hunts the hang on demand, invisible
  to `ci-usage.py` for carrying neither trigger. **Three organization workflows** ride unedited at
  tidymodels' shared blobs (`lock.yaml`, `pr-commands.yaml`, `format-suggest.yaml`, M33): no
  `push`/`pull_request` trigger, so neither the filter nor `ci-usage.py` sees them; `format-suggest.yaml`
  runs `air format .` (see DESIGN).
- Locating a hang, since the cap only ends one: `HangTraceReporter` (`tests/testthat/helper-hang-trace.R`)
  writes a timestamped start/end line per test file and per `test_that()` block to unbuffered `stderr()`, so
  a killed job's last unmatched `start` names the block it died in (M14, per-test M16). Under parallel files
  it runs in the parent in testthat's live-update mode, one pair per file and block (M52).
- `.github/ci-usage.py` measures the first two over any window in GitHub's
  90-day retention (baseline: `.github/ci-usage-baseline.md`), counting commits
  from `git log` and never crediting a cancelled run its whole would-be duration.
- **The merge clause, for the filters:** cairn never merges red or pending CI. A
  filtered event produces no run, so its check is absent rather than pending and
  merging past it is correct; what it forbids is a check that ran and failed, or
  one still running. Required status checks (none here) would leave a filtered
  check `Pending` forever.
- Change governance: the dependency surface is DESCRIPTION Imports/Suggests, and
  a breaking change warns via `lifecycle::deprecate_warn()` before removal. The
  gates themselves are universal (tracking-rules "Universal tracking rules").
- Every newly exported object gets a `_pkgdown.yml` reference-index row in the same commit.
- Every committed test fixture carries reproducible provenance: its source, the
  committed `data-raw/` generator that rebuilds it from scratch, and any seed —
  the R-mechanical form of the universal Reproducibility hard-stop. That content
  is required; its shape is the repo's choice (a `provenance` attribute, embedded
  `.rds`/`.rda` fields, or a header comment naming source + generator + seed).

## release-walk
Followed by `/cairn-release` — a CRAN release walk (never self-submits):
- Version decision (patch/minor/major) from the declared changelog; pre-1.0 conventions per DESIGN.md.
- Changelog consolidation (the declared file): retitle the dev heading to the version; group entries; prune noise.
- Full local verification: `devtools::document()` (no diff), `devtools::test()`
  and `devtools::check()` clean, `devtools::build_readme()`, `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()`,
  `urlchecker::url_check()`.
- Wide checks as applicable: `devtools::check_win_devel()` and/or R-hub; `revdepcheck` if dependents exist.
- Update `cran-comments.md` (test environments, check results, NOTE justifications, revdep summary).
- Bump `Version:` in DESCRIPTION.
- Handoff checklist (user runs): `devtools::submit_cran()`, confirm the CRAN
  email, then `usethis::use_github_release()` + `usethis::use_dev_version()`.

## init-detection
Recognized by `cairn-init` when a **`DESCRIPTION` file is present** at the repo
root. Carries the `.Rbuildignore` `^cairn$` entry (keeps the tracking dir out
of the built package).

## greenfield-openers
Language-specific opener `cairn-init` asks in a new/empty R package; the
universal openers (CRAN intent, numeric-work oracle verification) come from
cairn-init's universal layer.

- **Compiled code?** Rcpp / RcppArmadillo / C / C++ / Fortran, or pure R?
  Compiled means a `src/` dir, `LinkingTo`, a C/C++ toolchain, and `R CMD
  check` compiling on every check; adding it later is additive, so pure R is
  the reversible default. Lands in DESIGN Conventions (a "compiled code via
  <pkg>" line) and informs the `verify` / `test-doctrine` check surface.

## changelog
The repo's changelog file, read by `/hotfix`, the release-walk, and the
consistency-gate: **`NEWS.md`** (the R-package convention).
