"""Measure what this repository's GitHub Actions runs actually cost in machine time.

Two mechanisms waste runs, and this script measures both so a change to the
workflows can be judged against a recorded baseline rather than an impression:

  skipped    a default-branch commit that changed no packaged file -- it could
             not have broken the package, so the run it fires could not learn
             anything. Classified by the very `paths-ignore` list the workflows
             carry, read out of the workflow files rather than restated here,
             so the measurement cannot drift away from the thing it measures.

  superseded a run still executing when a later run on the same branch and
             workflow was created. Its answer is about a commit nobody is
             waiting on any more.

The two overlap -- a default-branch tracking commit can be both -- so they are
reported side by side and never summed.

Two things this script is careful about, because getting either wrong makes it
flatter the change it exists to measure:

  The commit list comes from `git log`, never from the runs those commits
  fired. A run-derived list goes blind exactly when the path filter starts
  working: a skipped commit fires no run, so it would silently leave the
  denominator and the filter's effect would read as zero.

  Cancelling a superseded run reclaims only the tail still to come when its
  successor was created, not the run's whole duration. Both are reported --
  `superseded` is what those runs cost, `reclaimed` is what cancelling them
  saves -- and only the second is a saving.

Auth comes from `gh`, which the script shells out to; there is no token
handling and no third-party dependency.

Usage:
    .github/ci-usage.py                     # the recorded baseline window
    .github/ci-usage.py --since 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z --until 2026-09-01T00:00:00Z
    .github/ci-usage.py --format json

Note that GitHub retains workflow runs for 90 days by default, so a window
older than that returns nothing however correct the query is.
