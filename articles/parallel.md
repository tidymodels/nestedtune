# Running the outer loop in parallel

Nested cross-validation fits many models, and the outer folds are
independent of one another.
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
and its siblings run those folds on [mirai](https://mirai.r-lib.org/)
daemons when a pool is connected, and serially otherwise. Nothing in the
call changes between the two. This page starts a pool of two daemons,
runs the getting-started guide’s loop on it, shows the result identical
to the same run made serially, and then goes through what the parallel
path checks before it dispatches, what it sends to each daemon, what to
do while developing the package, and how a run stops.

[`?nested_tune_grid`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
carries the reference version of each of those under its parallel
section. This page shows them running.

``` r

library(tidymodels)
library(nestedtune)
```

## The design and the workflow

These are the guide’s, unchanged: five outer folds of `mtcars`, five
inner folds under each, a random forest with two parameters marked for
tuning, and a grid of six candidates.
[`vignette("nested-cv")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.md)
walks through each of them.

``` r

set.seed(1)

folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = vfold_cv(v = 5),
  inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)
)

rf <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune(), trees = 500) |>
  set_engine("ranger") |>
  set_mode("regression")

wf <- workflow(mpg ~ ., rf)

grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2L, 5L, 8L), min_n = c(2L, 10L))
```

## Starting a pool

Parallelism is switched on by connecting daemons and off by
disconnecting them. There is no argument on the loop functions for it.
[`mirai::daemons()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/reference/daemons.html)
starts the pool, and
[`mirai::status()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/reference/status.html)
reports how many daemons are connected. Two or more is the threshold,
the same one tune uses.

``` r

mirai::daemons(2)

mirai::status()$connections
#> [1] 2
```

Each daemon is a separate R process. It does not inherit the options,
library paths, or environment variables this session set after it was
launched, and it loads nestedtune from an installed library rather than
from this session. Both points matter below.

## The pre-flight

Before any fold is dispatched, the call asks every connected daemon
whether it can load nestedtune, whether its copy defines the same
internal functions this session’s copy does, and whether it can load
each package the workflow and the tuner need, here parsnip, workflows
and ranger. A daemon that fails any of those stops the call with a
message naming how many daemons are affected and what is missing, rather
than letting the run go ahead and every fold come back as an opaque
worker failure. A daemon that does not answer within the bound is
reported as a non-response, which is a different message, so a slow
daemon is never told to install a package it already has. The bound is
thirty seconds by default and is an R option,
`nestedtune.preflight_timeout`, in milliseconds.

That first round trip is also what makes each daemon load the tidymodels
stack, so the first parallel call after starting a pool is the slow one.
Later calls in the same session reuse what the daemons already loaded.

## Running the loop

The call is the guide’s call. With a pool connected the outer folds are
dispatched to the daemons, and each fold’s inner tuning runs serially on
its daemon, because parallelism inside a fold on top of parallelism
across folds would oversubscribe the cores.

``` r

set.seed(2)

par_res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)

par_res
#> 
#> ── Nested cross-validation results ────────────────────────────────────
#> Outer resamples: 5-fold cross-validation
#> # A tibble: 5 × 9
#>   splits         id    .metrics .selected .inner_metrics    .notes  
#>   <list>         <chr> <list>   <list>    <list>            <list>  
#> 1 <split [25/7]> Fold1 <tibble> <tibble>  <tibble [12 × 8]> <tibble>
#> 2 <split [25/7]> Fold2 <tibble> <tibble>  <tibble [12 × 8]> <tibble>
#> 3 <split [26/6]> Fold3 <tibble> <tibble>  <tibble [12 × 8]> <tibble>
#> 4 <split [26/6]> Fold4 <tibble> <tibble>  <tibble [12 × 8]> <tibble>
#> 5 <split [26/6]> Fold5 <tibble> <tibble>  <tibble [12 × 8]> <tibble>
#> # ℹ 3 more variables: .completed <lgl>, .tuning_seed <int>,
#> #   .outer_fit_seed <int>
#> ℹ Use `summary()` for what the run means: which folds failed, what
#>   each one selected, and the estimate across them.
```

The result carries no mark of how it was computed. That is deliberate,
and the serial run below shows what it buys.

## Stopping the pool

`mirai::daemons(0)` disconnects the daemons. After it the same call runs
serially.

``` r

mirai::daemons(0)

mirai::status()$connections
#> [1] 0
```

## The same run, serially

The seed is the same, so the serial run is the same procedure on the
same resamples. Each outer fold draws its tuning seed from the session
state at entry, by its position in the design, before anything is
dispatched, and each daemon then pins the same generator kind the serial
path uses. So the fold’s inner tuning sees the same random stream
whichever process runs it.

``` r

set.seed(2)

ser_res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)
```

``` r

same <- c(
  metrics = identical(par_res$.metrics, ser_res$.metrics),
  selected = identical(par_res$.selected, ser_res$.selected),
  tuning_seed = identical(par_res$.tuning_seed, ser_res$.tuning_seed)
)

same
#>     metrics    selected tuning_seed 
#>        TRUE        TRUE        TRUE
```

[`identical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/identical.html) on the outer
scores, the selections and the tuning seeds returns TRUE for each: the
scores, the selections and the seeds match, and which run used daemons
is not recoverable from either. That is what lets a pool be a matter of
the session rather than of the analysis: a script gives the same answer
on a laptop with no daemons and on a workstation with many.

## What crosses the wire

A fold’s payload is its outer split, its inner resamples and its two
seeds; the workflow, the grid and the tuner’s settings travel beside it.
Every split in a design indexes one shared copy of the data, but
serializing does not preserve that sharing, so sending the splits as
they are would send one copy of the data per split. The data is
therefore stripped from each split before dispatch and refilled on the
daemon, and what crosses is the fold’s row indices plus one copy of the
data per fold. Two things this does not reach, both of them objects you
supply rather than anything the package builds. A recipe keeps a copy of
the data it was created with, and a formula carries the environment it
was written in, so a workflow built inside a function that holds a large
object sends that object with every fold. The recipe’s copy is the
recipe’s own record and travels with every fold; building the workflow
at the top level avoids the second.

## Developing against daemons

Daemons load nestedtune from an installed library. Under
`devtools::load_all()` the host session runs the source tree, and the
daemons cannot see it. With no installed copy in the library, the
pre-flight stops the call. When the library does hold one, the daemons
run that copy, which may be older than the source the host is running.
The pre-flight catches the case where the older copy is missing a
function the host’s copy has, and asks you to reinstall and restart the
pool. A running daemon keeps the namespace it already loaded, so
reinstalling underneath it changes nothing until the pool is restarted.

For development, prime the daemons with the source tree instead:

``` r

mirai::everywhere(pkgload::load_all("path/to/nestedtune"))
```

## Interrupting and cancelling

Pressing interrupt at the console while folds are outstanding unwinds
the blocking wait, restores the random-number state, and asks the
daemons to stop the folds they have not finished, so the pool goes idle
rather than computing results nobody will read. Stopping is a request. A
fold already inside a compiled fitting routine may not be interruptible,
and one that has nearly finished may simply finish. Nothing about an
interrupted run is recorded, because a fold that was never given a
chance to run has not failed.

Cancelling needs mirai’s dispatcher, the process that hands tasks to
daemons and can recall them. `mirai::daemons(n)` starts one by default.
A pool started with `dispatcher = FALSE` has no dispatcher, so the
request cannot reach the daemons and the outstanding folds run to
completion. The results of such a pool are correct, and it is not
refused. What it lacks is the ability to stop, and the call says so at
dispatch with a warning of class `nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable`, once
per run.

Here is that pool. The first chunk runs the loop on it with the warning
muted and checks the result against the serial run. The second repeats
the call and catches the warning with
[`rlang::catch_cnd()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/catch_cnd.html)
to show its class.

``` r

mirai::daemons(2, dispatcher = FALSE)

set.seed(2)

nd_res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)

identical(nd_res$.metrics, ser_res$.metrics)
#> [1] TRUE
```

``` r

set.seed(2)

caught <- rlang::catch_cnd(
  nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid),
  classes = "nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable"
)

class(caught)
#> [1] "nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable" "rlang_warning"                  
#> [3] "warning"                         "condition"

mirai::daemons(0)
```

The message itself names the remedy: restart the pool with
`mirai::daemons(n)`, which starts a dispatcher by default.

    These mirai daemons were started without a dispatcher, so this run
    cannot be cancelled.
    ℹ Interrupting it returns control to you, but the outer folds keep
      computing on the pool and their results are never read.
    ℹ For a pool that stops when you do, restart it with
      `mirai::daemons(n)`, which starts a dispatcher by default.

One case the call cannot tell apart is documented rather than guessed
at. Calling `mirai::daemons(0)` while folds are outstanding produces
exactly what a daemon dying mid-fold produces, so tearing the pool down
that way is recorded as fold failures rather than as a cancellation. The
other folds keep their results.

## What this example cannot show

`mtcars` has 32 rows and the grid has 6 points, so each fold takes a
fraction of a second, and two daemons loading the tidymodels stack cost
more than the folds save. This page shows the parallel path working and
its result matching the serial one, not a speedup. The speedup arrives
where the folds are expensive: larger data, a bigger grid, a slower
engine, or preprocessing the loop has to redo in every fold. The
arithmetic in
[`vignette("nested-cv")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.md)
says where the cost lives, and what is parallel here is the outer loop
over that cost.
