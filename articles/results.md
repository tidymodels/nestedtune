# Reading the results

Every driver in this package returns the same kind of object, a
`nested_results`, and the getting-started guide,
[`vignette("nested-cv")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.md),
reads the print, the summary, the estimate, the selections and both
plots off it. This page reads the whole object. It walks the columns one
at a time, runs each of the readers on one result, shows what a run
looks like when one outer fold fails, says which dplyr verbs keep the
class and which shed it, and ends with the two arguments the runs above
do not use, `event_level` and `eval_time`.

``` r

library(tidymodels)
library(nestedtune)
```

## The run

The design, the workflow and the grid are the guide’s, unchanged: five
outer folds of `mtcars`, five inner folds under each, and a random
forest with two parameters marked for tuning.

``` r

set.seed(1)

folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = vfold_cv(v = 5),
  inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)
)

rf <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune(), trees = 500) |>
  set_engine("ranger") |>
  set_mode("regression")

wf <- workflow(mpg ~ ., rf)

grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2L, 5L, 8L), min_n = c(2L, 10L))
```

``` r

set.seed(2)

res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)

```

## What the columns hold

The object is a tibble with one row per outer fold, and the print above
shows the columns that fit, its footer naming the rest. Each holds one
piece of what that fold did.

``` r

names(res)
#> [1] "splits"          "id"              ".metrics"       
#> [4] ".selected"       ".inner_metrics"  ".notes"         
#> [7] ".completed"      ".tuning_seed"    ".outer_fit_seed"
```

`splits` is the fold’s outer split, an ordinary rsample split whose
analysis rows the tuning saw and whose assessment rows scored the fold’s
model.

``` r

res$splits[[1]]
#> <Analysis/Assess/Total>
#> <25/7/32>
```

`id` is the fold’s label, copied from the design. A repeated design
carries more than one label column, and the object records which columns
they are.

``` r

res$id
#> [1] "Fold1" "Fold2" "Fold3" "Fold4" "Fold5"
```

`.metrics` is the score of the fold’s finalized model on its assessment
rows, one row per metric, in the shape
[`tune::last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html)
produces. It is what
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
averages.

``` r

res$.metrics[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 2 × 4
#>   .metric .estimator .estimate .config        
#>   <chr>   <chr>          <dbl> <chr>          
#> 1 rmse    standard       1.23  pre0_mod0_post0
#> 2 rsq     standard       0.911 pre0_mod0_post0
```

`.selected` is the candidate the fold’s inner tuning chose, a one-row
tibble of the tuned parameters. It is what
[`collect_selections()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md),
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html),
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md)
and the default
[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
read.

``` r

res$.selected[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>    mtry min_n .config        
#>   <int> <int> <chr>          
#> 1     8     2 pre0_mod5_post0
```

`.inner_metrics` is the whole table the inner search scored, every
candidate on every inner resample, averaged. It is what the fold’s
selection was made from;
[`collect_inner_metrics()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
stacks it across folds, and
[`vignette("tuners")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/tuners.md)
shows how its shape differs by search.

``` r

res$.inner_metrics[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 12 × 8
#>     mtry min_n .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config        
#>    <int> <int> <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <chr>          
#>  1     2     2 rmse    standard   2.87      5  0.435  pre0_mod1_post0
#>  2     2     2 rsq     standard   0.814     5  0.0935 pre0_mod1_post0
#>  3     2    10 rmse    standard   3.09      5  0.548  pre0_mod2_post0
#>  4     2    10 rsq     standard   0.776     5  0.115  pre0_mod2_post0
#>  5     5     2 rmse    standard   2.88      5  0.446  pre0_mod3_post0
#>  6     5     2 rsq     standard   0.834     5  0.0900 pre0_mod3_post0
#>  7     5    10 rmse    standard   2.88      5  0.510  pre0_mod4_post0
#>  8     5    10 rsq     standard   0.803     5  0.115  pre0_mod4_post0
#>  9     8     2 rmse    standard   2.85      5  0.419  pre0_mod5_post0
#> 10     8     2 rsq     standard   0.834     5  0.0942 pre0_mod5_post0
#> 11     8    10 rmse    standard   2.89      5  0.497  pre0_mod6_post0
#> 12     8    10 rsq     standard   0.805     5  0.115  pre0_mod6_post0
```

`.notes` holds what went wrong inside the fold, in tune’s shape with a
`location` naming the stage. A fold that ran cleanly has no rows.

``` r

res$.notes[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 0 × 4
#> # ℹ 4 variables: location <chr>, type <chr>, note <chr>, trace <list>
```

`.completed` says whether the fold produced a score. The section on a
failed fold below shows a `FALSE`.

``` r

res$.completed
#> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

`.tuning_seed` and `.outer_fit_seed` are the two seeds each fold ran
under, drawn at entry and fixed by the fold’s position in the design.
The guide’s reproducibility section shows how to restore them, and the
help pages for
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
and
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
give the recipe for replaying one fold by hand.

``` r

select(res, .tuning_seed, .outer_fit_seed)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   .tuning_seed .outer_fit_seed
#>          <int>           <int>
#> 1    794080207       314911494
#> 2   1906307464       554751325
#> 3   2010156236       226245929
#> 4   1118907979      1740692099
#> 5   2046114256      1910444850
```

The description of the run itself rides on the object as attributes
rather than columns, and
[`vignette("tuners")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/tuners.md)
reads one of them, `procedure`.

## The readers

Printing describes the object in hand.
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) says what the run
means: how much of the design ran, what each fold chose, and the
estimate.

``` r

summary(res)
#> 
#> ── Nested cross-validation results ────────────────────────────────────
#> Outer resamples: 5-fold cross-validation
#> Outer folds: 5 requested, 5 completed
#> 
#> ── Selected parameters ──
#> 
#> ! mtry: 8, 8, 5, 8, 5 (folds disagree)
#> ✔ min_n: 2 (all 5 completed folds agree)
#> 
#> ── Estimate (5 of 5 outer folds) ──
#> 
#> rmse (standard): 2.49
#> rsq (standard): 0.842
#> 
#> ℹ A nested estimate describes the tune-and-fit procedure, not a model
#>   you can deploy. Build that with `nested_final_fit()`, and report
#>   this estimate as what its procedure achieves.
```

[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
is the estimate as a table, the mean and standard error of the outer
scores. With `summarize = FALSE` it is the outer scores themselves, one
row per fold and metric, which is each fold’s `.metrics` rows, less
`.config`, with the fold label beside them.

``` r

collect_metrics(res)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 5
#>   .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err
#>   <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
#> 1 rmse    standard   2.49      5  0.447 
#> 2 rsq     standard   0.842     5  0.0293

collect_metrics(res, summarize = FALSE)
#> # A tibble: 10 × 4
#>    id    .metric .estimator .estimate
#>    <chr> <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>

#>  4 Fold2 rsq     standard       0.819
#>  5 Fold3 rmse    standard       2.48 
#>  6 Fold3 rsq     standard       0.805

#>  9 Fold5 rmse    standard       3.69 
#> 10 Fold5 rsq     standard       0.911
```

[`collect_selections()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
and
[`collect_inner_metrics()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
stack `.selected` and `.inner_metrics` over the folds that completed,
with the fold label beside each row, so what every fold chose and
everything every fold scored are read as one table each.
[`collect_notes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html),
further down, does the same for `.notes` over every fold.

``` r

collect_selections(res)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4

#> # ℹ 50 more rows
```

[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md)
counts the selections: one row per distinct combination the folds chose,
with how many completed folds chose it, `n`, and that count as a share
of the completed folds, `prop`. The most frequent row describes how
stable the tuning procedure’s choice was on this data. It is not the
final model’s parameters, which come from
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
running the procedure once more on the whole dataset.

``` r

agreement(res)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 4
#>    mtry min_n     n  prop
#>   <int> <int> <int> <dbl>
#> 1     8     2     3   0.6
#> 2     5     2     2   0.4
```

[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
draws the same two facts. The default view is the selections, one panel
per tuned parameter and one point per outer fold.

``` r

autoplot(res)
```

![One panel per tuned parameter, mtry and min_n, with one point per
outer fold at the value that fold's inner tuning
selected.](results_files/figure-html/autoplot-parameters-1.png)

The other view is the outer scores, one panel per metric and one point
per fold, with a dashed line at the mean that
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
reports.

``` r

autoplot(res, type = "performance")
```

![One panel per metric, rmse and rsq, with one point per outer fold's
score on its assessment rows and a dashed line at the mean across
folds.](results_files/figure-html/autoplot-performance-1.png)

## When a fold fails

A fold that fails does not end the run. The other folds keep their
results, and the fold that failed is recorded rather than dropped. To
show that on the guide’s run, the workflow below adds one preprocessing
step a careful reader might write anyway: a range check on horsepower,
which refuses to predict for a car whose horsepower lies outside the
range the model was trained on, beyond a small slack. One car, the
Maserati Bora, has far more horsepower than any other in `mtcars`, 335
against 264 for the next. The fold that holds it out cannot score it,
and that fold fails.

``` r

rec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) |>
  check_range(hp)

wf_checked <- workflow(rec, rf)
```

``` r

set.seed(2)

failed <- nested_tune_grid(wf_checked, folds, grid = grid)
#> Warning: All models failed. Run `show_notes(.Last.tune.result)` for more
#> information.
#> Warning in nested_tune_grid(wf_checked, folds, grid = grid): ! 1 of 5 outer folds failed.
#> ✖ Failed: "Fold1".
#> ℹ See `x$.notes` for what went wrong.

stopifnot(sum(!failed$.completed) == 1L)
```

``` r

```

The run warns twice as it finishes: tune’s own warning from the outer
fit that produced nothing, then this package’s, naming the fold. The
chunk mutes tune’s progress messages and keeps its warnings. The print
counts the failure, `.completed` is `FALSE` for the fold that failed,
and its `.notes` say where.
[`collect_notes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
stacks every fold’s `.notes` into one table with the fold label beside
them, so the failed fold’s notes are the rows carrying its label.

``` r

failed_id <- failed |>
  filter(!.completed) |>
  pull(id)

failed_id
#> [1] "Fold1"

notes <- collect_notes(failed)

failed_notes <- filter(notes, id == failed_id)

select(failed_notes, location, type, note)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   location                                      type  note             
#>   <chr>                                         <chr> <chr>            
#> 1 outer fit                                     error "The outer fit p…
#> 2 outer fit: preprocessor 1/1 (prediction data) error "\u001b[1m\u001b…
```

The first row is this package’s own note, and its `location` names the
stage: Fold1 failed at the outer fit, the fit and score on the outer
split, after its inner tuning had finished. The rows after it are tune’s
notes about the cause, relabelled with the stage they came from. A fold
that fails during inner tuning reads the same way with `inner tuning` as
the stage.

A fold can also complete and carry notes. The Maserati sits in the
analysis set of every other fold, so each of those folds had one inner
resample that held it out, and the range check refused that resample for
every candidate. Some folds carry a second note of the same kind from
the low end of the range, an inner resample that held out a car with
less horsepower than any it trained on. Tuning still returned a
candidate, from the inner resamples that ran, and the fold finished. Its
notes say so. Counting the stacked notes by fold shows how many each
carries (a fold with none would be absent from the count), and the first
fold in the table other than the failed one reads like this:

``` r

count(notes, id)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   id        n
#>   <chr> <int>
#> 1 Fold1     2
#> 2 Fold2     2
#> 3 Fold3     1
#> 4 Fold4     1
#> 5 Fold5     1

noted_id <- notes |>
  filter(id != failed_id) |>
  slice(1) |>
  pull(id)

noted_id
#> [1] "Fold2"

notes |>
  filter(id == noted_id) |>
  select(location, type, note)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   location                                                 type  note  
#>   <chr>                                                    <chr> <chr> 
#> 1 inner tuning (Fold3): preprocessor 1/1 (prediction data) error "\u00…
#> 2 inner tuning (Fold5): preprocessor 1/1 (prediction data) error "\u00…
```

The label in parentheses names the inner resample, a fold of this outer
fold’s own inner design, not another outer fold. So `.completed` being
`TRUE` beside a non-empty `.notes` means exactly this: the fold worked,
on less than the whole inner design it was given.

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) on a run with a
failed fold still answers, and warns first. The first chunk below
catches the warning with
[`rlang::catch_cnd()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/catch_cnd.html)
to show its class and its message. The second prints the summary, with
the warning muted.

``` r

partial_warning <- rlang::catch_cnd(
  summary(failed),
  classes = "nestedtune_partial_summary"
)

class(partial_warning)
#> [1] "nestedtune_partial_summary" "rlang_warning"             
#> [3] "warning"                    "condition"

cat(conditionMessage(partial_warning))
#> ! This summary covers 4 of 5 outer folds.
#> ✖ Failed: "Fold1".
#> ℹ It describes the folds that ran, not the design that was requested.
```

``` r

The warning’s class lets a script catch it and decide what a partial run
is worth. The message names how many folds the summary covers and how
many the design asked for, and the summary itself describes the folds
that ran: the selections are those 4 folds’ selections, and the estimate
is the mean over their 4 scores, with the failed fold absent rather than
filled in.
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html),
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md),
[`collect_selections()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
and
[`collect_inner_metrics()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
warn the same way, and
[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
leaves the failed fold’s place on its axis empty. A run in which no fold
completed is different:
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) still describes it,
but
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html),
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md),
[`collect_selections()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md),

[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
and
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
refuse it, because there is no estimate to report for a design that did
not execute.

## What dplyr keeps and what it sheds

The object is a tibble, so dplyr’s verbs work on it, and one rule
decides what they hand back: a verb that only reorders the rows or adds
or reorders columns returns a `nested_results`, and a verb that adds or
removes a row, or drops or overwrites one of the columns above, returns
a bare tibble, because an object that no longer holds what the run
produced cannot answer for the run. Adding a column keeps the class.

``` r

with_position <- mutate(res, position = row_number())

class(with_position)
#> [1] "nested_results" "tbl_df"         "tbl"            "data.frame"
```

Dropping a fold sheds it. The natural case is keeping only the folds
that completed on the run above, which removes one row.

``` r

completed_only <- filter(failed, .completed)

class(completed_only)
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

So does a column subset that leaves the run’s record behind, through
base `[` rather than a dplyr verb, since the same rule governs it.

``` r

class(res[, "id"])
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

Both of those hand back the data and nothing more: a plain tibble print,
no summary of the run, no
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html).
That is the point. A table that has lost a fold, or lost the columns the
run wrote, cannot describe itself as a five-fold design, so it stops
describing itself. To read a partial run, read the run:
`collect_metrics(failed)` already averages the folds that completed, and
warns that it did.

## Two more arguments: `event_level` and `eval_time`

Every tuning driver takes two more arguments than the runs above used,
and both reach tune untouched;
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
takes neither, and reads both back from the results object.
`event_level` is for classification: it names which level of the outcome
factor counts as the event, `"first"` unless you say otherwise, and it
sets the same slot on the inner tuning and on the outer scoring fit at
once. A regression or censored-regression run ignores it, as tune does.
`eval_time` is for censored regression, and it changes the shape of the
result, so the rest of this section runs one.

``` r

set.seed(51)

n <- 180
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rnorm(n)
lp <- 0.9 * x1 - 0.6 * x2
early <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.45)
event_time <- ifelse(
  early == 1,
  runif(n, 0.02, 0.6) * exp(-lp / 6),
  rlnorm(n, meanlog = log(15) - lp, sdlog = 0.8)
)
censor_time <- runif(n, 3, 60)

surv_df <- tibble(
  time = pmin(event_time, censor_time),
  event = as.numeric(event_time <= censor_time),
  x1 = x1,
  x2 = x2
)
```

The data is simulated: two predictors, a time, and an event indicator
that is zero where the observation was censored before its event. The
model is a parametric survival regression whose one tunable is the
distribution of the event times, and the grid names three.

``` r

library(censored)

surv_spec <- survival_reg(dist = tune()) |>
  set_engine("survival") |>
  set_mode("censored regression")

surv_wf <- workflow(survival::Surv(time, event) ~ x1 + x2, surv_spec)

surv_grid <- tibble(dist = c("weibull", "lognormal", "exponential"))
```

A dynamic survival metric is evaluated at a time: the Brier score at one
time asks how well the model predicts who has survived to that point. So
the metric has one value per time, and `eval_time` is where the times
are given. They reach the inner tuning, which selects on the first of
them and warns once per fold to say so (the chunk mutes those warnings),
and the outer scoring fit, which scores at each.

``` r

set.seed(61)

surv_folds <- nested_resamples(
  surv_df,
  outside = vfold_cv(v = 3),
  inside = vfold_cv(v = 3)
)

set.seed(62)

surv_res <- nested_tune_grid(
  surv_wf,
  surv_folds,
  grid = surv_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(brier_survival),
  eval_time = c(0.5, 10)
)

collect_metrics(surv_res)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 6
#>   .metric        .estimator .eval_time  mean     n std_err
#>   <chr>          <chr>           <dbl> <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
#> 1 brier_survival standard          0.5 0.251     3 0.00584
#> 2 brier_survival standard         10   0.222     3 0.00901
```

The estimate carries an `.eval_time` column, and has one row per metric
and time: the Brier score at 0.5 and at 10, each the mean over the outer
folds of that fold’s score at that time. The per-fold table carries the
same column, and so does each fold’s `.metrics`.

``` r

collect_metrics(surv_res, summarize = FALSE)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>   id    .metric        .estimator .eval_time .estimate
#>   <chr> <chr>          <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>
#> 1 Fold1 brier_survival standard          0.5     0.259
#> 2 Fold1 brier_survival standard         10       0.230
#> 3 Fold2 brier_survival standard          0.5     0.240
#> 4 Fold2 brier_survival standard         10       0.204
#> 5 Fold3 brier_survival standard          0.5     0.255
#> 6 Fold3 brier_survival standard         10       0.231

surv_res$.selected[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 1 × 2
#>   dist      .config        
#>   <chr>     <chr>          
#> 1 lognormal pre0_mod2_post0
```

Everything else reads as before.
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md)
counts the selected distributions the way it counted `mtry` above:

``` r

agreement(surv_res)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   dist          n  prop
#>   <chr>     <int> <dbl>
#> 1 lognormal     2 0.667
#> 2 weibull       1 0.333
```

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) and the default
[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
read the same `.selected` column, and `autoplot(type = "performance")`
draws one panel per metric and time.
