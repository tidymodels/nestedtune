# Choosing the inner tuner

The getting-started guide,
[`vignette("nested-cv")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.md),
tunes each outer fold over a fixed grid with
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md).
That is one of five ways the inner search can run. The other four are
tune’s Bayesian optimization and finetune’s two racing methods and its
simulated annealing, and each has a driver here that takes the same
design and workflow and returns the same kind of object. This page runs
all four on the guide’s example, shows what each fold records about its
search, shows how a tune control object reaches the inner call, and says
what differs from calling tune or finetune directly. A workflow with
nothing to tune takes none of the five: each refuses it at entry and
names
[`nested_fit_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_fit_resamples.md),
which
[`vignette("nested-cv")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.md)
shows scoring a fixed workflow on the same design. The last section runs
a baseline and two tuned workflows through one design in one call, with
[`nested_workflow_map()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_workflow_map.md).

``` r

library(tidymodels)
library(nestedtune)
```

## The design and the workflow

These are the guide’s, unchanged: five outer folds of `mtcars`, five
inner folds under each, and a random forest with two parameters marked
for tuning.

``` r

set.seed(1)

folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = vfold_cv(v = 5),
  inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)
)

rf <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune(), trees = 500) |>
  set_engine("ranger") |>
  set_mode("regression")

wf <- workflow(mpg ~ ., rf)

grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2L, 5L, 8L), min_n = c(2L, 10L))
```

The grid tuner and the racers score the candidates they are given. The
Bayesian and annealing searches propose their own candidates instead,
and to do that they need to know each parameter’s range. The default
range of `mtry` is not known until the data is seen, so a search over it
fails at inner tuning in every fold with the message that `mtry` must be
a parameter object without unknowns. The parameter set below fixes that
range by hand, and bounds `min_n` to the grid’s range too, because its
default runs past the size of an inner analysis set here.

``` r

params <- update(
  extract_parameter_set_dials(wf),
  mtry = mtry(c(2L, 8L)),
  min_n = min_n(c(2L, 10L))
)

params
#> Collection of 2 parameters for tuning
#> 
#>  identifier  type    object
#>        mtry  mtry nparam[+]
#>       min_n min_n nparam[+]
#> 
```

## Bayesian optimization

[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md)
runs
[`tune::tune_bayes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_bayes.html)
inside each outer fold. The search starts from a small space-filling set
of candidates, scores them on the inner resamples, and then proposes one
new candidate per iteration from a Gaussian process fitted to the scores
so far. `initial` and `iter` are the sizes of those two stages, kept
small here so the page builds quickly.

``` r

set.seed(2)

bayes <- nested_tune_bayes(
  wf,
  folds,
  param_info = params,
  initial = 4,
  iter = 3
)

bayes

```

Each fold scored 7 candidates on 5 inner resamples, which is 35 fits per
outer fold for tuning, against the 30 the guide’s grid costs. The print
above notes that the folds did not search the same grid: the same number
of candidates each, but not the same ones. That is the nature of the
search rather than a fault: each fold proposes candidates from its own
scores, so no two folds need score the same set, and the note is there
so that a reader of the summary does not mistake the selections for a
vote over shared candidates.

`.inner_metrics` holds what the search inside one fold saw. Here is the
first fold’s:

``` r

bayes$.inner_metrics[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 14 × 9

#> 11     6     5 rmse    standard   2.83      5  0.458  iter2           2
#> 12     6     5 rsq     standard   0.837     5  0.102  iter2           2
#> 13     3    10 rmse    standard   2.99      5  0.515  iter3           3
#> 14     3    10 rsq     standard   0.786     5  0.117  iter3           3
```

The `.iter` column says which stage each candidate came from: `.iter` of
0 marks the initial set, and the proposals run up to 3. A control that
stops the search early, shown further down, is visible here as a fold
whose `.iter` stops short of `iter`.

## Racing

The two racing methods in finetune take the same grid the guide uses and
score every candidate on a few inner resamples first. From then on,
after each further resample, a candidate that is clearly worse than the
current best is dropped, so the fits that a full grid search would spend
on losing candidates are saved.
[`nested_tune_race_anova()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_race.md)
decides with a repeated measures ANOVA fitted by `lme4`, and
[`nested_tune_race_win_loss()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_race.md)
with a Bradley-Terry model of pairwise wins fitted by `BradleyTerry2`.

``` r

set.seed(3)

race <- nested_tune_race_anova(wf, folds, grid = grid)

```

A fold’s `.inner_metrics` from a race is the whole grid, and the `n`
column says how many inner resamples each candidate was scored on before
it was dropped or the race ended.
[`collect_inner_metrics()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_selections.md)
stacks those tables with the fold label beside them, so summing `n` over
one metric’s rows counts the fits each fold spent on tuning. The fold
that spent the fewest is the one where elimination did the most work:

``` r

fits_per_fold <- collect_inner_metrics(race) |>
  filter(.metric == "rmse") |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(fits = sum(n))

fits_per_fold
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2

cheapest <- slice_min(fits_per_fold, fits, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE)

```

In `Fold3`, 4 of the 6 candidates show `n` below the 5 inner resamples,
so they were dropped before the race ended, and the fold spent 23 fits
on tuning where the full grid costs 30.

The win/loss race records the same table, and reads the same way. Its
fits per fold:

``` r

set.seed(4)

win_loss <- nested_tune_race_win_loss(wf, folds, grid = grid)

collect_inner_metrics(win_loss) |>
  filter(.metric == "rmse") |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(fits = sum(n))
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   id     fits
#>   <chr> <int>
#> 1 Fold1    30
#> 2 Fold2    30
#> 3 Fold3    30
#> 4 Fold4    28
#> 5 Fold5    30
```

## Simulated annealing

[`nested_tune_sim_anneal()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_sim_anneal.md)
runs
[`finetune::tune_sim_anneal()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_sim_anneal.html)
inside each outer fold. Like the Bayesian search it proposes its own
candidates and needs the parameter set above, but each proposal is a
small random move from the current candidate, accepted when it scores
better and sometimes when it scores worse. finetune prints a log of
every move by default; the control passed below keeps the page quiet,
and is the first use here of the `...` that the next section describes.

``` r

set.seed(5)

anneal <- nested_tune_sim_anneal(
  wf,
  folds,
  param_info = params,
  initial = 3,
  iter = 3,
  control = finetune::control_sim_anneal(verbose_iter = FALSE)
)

#> 12     5     6 rsq     standard   0.823     5  0.102  Iter3           3
```

`.iter` runs from 0, the initial candidates, to 3. Each fold scored 6
candidates on 5 inner resamples, 30 fits for tuning, the same as the
guide’s grid.

## Passing a control through `...`

None of the four drivers on this page has a `control` argument of its
own. A control object of the matching kind, `control_bayes()` for the
Bayesian driver,
[`finetune::control_race()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_race.html)
and
[`finetune::control_sim_anneal()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_sim_anneal.html)
for the others, is passed as `control` through `...`, and reaches the
inner tuning call in every fold. Here the Bayesian run is repeated under
a control that stops a fold’s search after three proposals in a row
bring no improvement.

``` r

set.seed(6)

stopped <- nested_tune_bayes(
  wf,
  folds,
  param_info = params,
  initial = 4,
  iter = 3,
  control = control_bayes(verbose = FALSE, no_improve = 3)
)
#> ! No improvement for 3 iterations; returning current results.

#>   `parallel_over`: NULL
#>   `backend_options`: NULL
#>   `workflow_size`: 100
```

This record says what ran, and a final fit built from this result
re-runs exactly that. Its `control` element is the control as it took
effect, not as it was passed. Two of its slots are this package’s to
set. `allow_par` is FALSE whatever the control said, because parallelism
belongs over the outer folds, and a second pool inside each fold would
contend with the first. `event_level` is set once, by the driver’s own
argument: a control left at tune’s default takes that argument’s level,
and a control naming a level that is neither tune’s default nor the
argument’s is refused at entry, naming both. One slot is missing from
the record. `seed` is dropped, because the Bayesian search’s seed is the
fold’s tuning seed, which the fold’s own `.tuning_seed` column already
holds, and the driver puts it back on the control at the point the inner
call is made.

## A set of workflows on one design

A comparison across model families needs every family scored on the same
outer folds.
[`nested_workflow_map()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_workflow_map.md)
takes a `workflow_set()` and the name of one driver, and runs each
workflow of the set through it on one design, so the results come back
side by side. Here the set holds the random forest above, a linear model
on the same predictors with nothing to tune, and a linear model on
principal components whose count is tuned. The forest’s grid goes in the
call; the components workflow cannot use it, so its own grid goes in the
set’s `option` column with `option_add()`.

``` r

pca <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) |>
  step_pca(all_predictors(), num_comp = tune())

wset <- as_workflow_set(
  forest = wf,
  baseline = workflow(mpg ~ ., linear_reg()),
  components = workflow(pca, linear_reg())
) |>
  option_add(grid = tibble(num_comp = 1:4), id = "components")

set.seed(7)
mapped <- nested_workflow_map(
  wset,
  fn = "nested_tune_grid",
  resamples = folds,
  grid = grid
)

mapped
#> 
#> ── Nested cross-validation results for a workflow set ─────────────────
#> Orchestrator: `nested_tune_grid()` (grid search)
#> Workflows: 3
#> ✔ "forest": 5 of 5 outer folds completed (grid search)
#> ✔ "baseline": 5 of 5 outer folds completed (no tuning)
#> ✔ "components": 5 of 5 outer folds completed (grid search)
#> ℹ Use `collect_metrics()` for every workflow's estimate under its id,
#>   and `x$result[[i]]` for one workflow's run.
```

The baseline has nothing to tune, so it ran through
[`nested_fit_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_fit_resamples.md)
whatever `fn` named, and the print says so beside its id. Each row’s
`result` is the object the named driver returns for that workflow,
called by hand with the same arguments under the same seed, so
everything the earlier sections read off one result reads off a row
here.

``` r

collect_metrics(mapped)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 6
#>   wflow_id   .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err
#>   <chr>      <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
#> 1 forest     rmse    standard   2.43      5  0.455 
#> 2 forest     rsq     standard   0.847     5  0.0265
#> 3 baseline   rmse    standard   4.42      5  0.571 
#> 4 baseline   rsq     standard   0.639     5  0.0859
#> 5 components rmse    standard   3.15      5  0.385 
#> 6 components rsq     standard   0.757     5  0.0666
```

[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
stacks each workflow’s estimate under its id, and the other readers
stack their tables the same way. What the set does not offer is a
ranking of its workflows or a fit of the best one: choosing among them
by these estimates would be a selection the outer loop did not nest, and
[`vignette("estimate")`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/estimate.md)
says why. The final fit for one workflow of the set is
`nested_final_fit(mapped, id = "forest")`.

## What differs from calling tune or finetune directly

Every statistical step is tune’s or finetune’s, and the driver adds the
loop around it. The differences a caller meets are these.

A control reaches the inner call through `...`, as above. Apart from the
three slots the previous section names, everything on it passes through
as given, including the slots that stop a search early, which is why one
fold’s `.inner_metrics` can be shorter than another’s.

The search’s own settings are arguments here rather than control slots.
`iter`, `initial` and `objective` on the Bayesian driver, `iter` and
`initial` on annealing, and `grid` on the racers reach the inner call
unchanged, with one narrowing: `initial` is a count, and an earlier
tuning result, which tune and finetune both accept there, is refused.

What comes back from the inner call is its metrics table and its
selection, never the tuning object itself. `.inner_metrics` is that
table, the whole grid for a race, and `.selected` is the candidate the
`select` rule picked on it by the first metric: `selection_rule("best")`
by default, or tune’s one-standard-error or percent-loss rule with the
parameter orderings the rule names. The rule is recorded with the
procedure, and the final fit selects by it. So a control’s
`save_workflow` slot costs its work inside every fold and returns
nothing on a nested run, and `extract` and `save_pred` reach the result
through the outer fit alone: a fold’s `.predictions` and `.extracts` are
what its outer fit produced, never the inner run’s. The final fit keeps
its tuning run whole, and that is where the inner run’s results are
reachable. The annealing control’s `save_history` slot writes finetune’s
search history to a file in the temporary directory of the process that
tuned, each fold overwriting the last, and nothing of it reaches the
result or the final fit.

The racing and annealing drivers refuse at entry when a package their
search needs is not installed, rather than one outer loop’s worth of
work later when finetune would ask for it, and the racers refuse a
`burn_in` that no fold’s inner design can meet before any fold runs.

Seeding is the guide’s contract on all four: seed the session before the
call, and each fold gets its own tuning and fitting seeds, all drawn
from that state at entry, so the same seed gives the same result
serially and in parallel. The help page of each driver gives the exact
hand-replication recipe for one fold.
