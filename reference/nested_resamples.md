# Build a nested resampling design without copying the data per outer fold

`nested_resamples()` builds the same nested resampling structure as
[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html),
but stores index vectors into the original data instead of a
materialized analysis set for every outer fold. For the same seed and
the same specifications it produces the same splits; what changes is the
size of the object that holds them.

## Usage

``` r
nested_resamples(data, outside, inside, ...)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- outside:

  The outer resampling specification, given either as an unevaluated
  call such as `vfold_cv(v = 5)` or as an already-evaluated `rset`
  object.

- inside:

  The inner resampling specification, given as an unevaluated call such
  as `vfold_cv(v = 5)`. Unlike `outside`, this cannot be an existing
  object, because it is evaluated once per outer fold.

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. All three arguments above are required, so
  the barrier is what turns a mistyped fourth into an error.

## Value

An object of class `nested_resamples`, which also carries the classes
[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
returns, so methods written against those keep working. It is the outer
`rset` with an `inner_resamples` list column added, one inner `rset` per
outer split.

## Details

[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
evaluates the inner specification against `as.data.frame(split)`, so
each outer fold's inner resamples reference their own copy of that
fold's analysis set. Object size therefore grows by roughly one copy of
the data for every outer fold. `nested_resamples()` evaluates the inner
specification the same way, against the same transient frame, but keeps
only the row indices it produces and remaps them onto the original data,
so the inner splits reference the single shared copy the caller already
has.

## Differences from rsample

The splits select the same rows.
[`rsample::analysis()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/as.data.frame.rsplit.html)
and
[`rsample::assessment()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/as.data.frame.rsplit.html)
return identical frames, attributes included, and each inner split
carries the class and the resample id rsample gives it, so
[`labels()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/labels.html) and
[`rsample::add_resample_id()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/add_resample_id.html)
behave the same. What differs is what the splits point at: nestedtune's
index the original data, rsample's index a materialized copy of each
outer fold's analysis set. One behavior differs on purpose.

An **outer bootstrap is refused**, not warned about. The same
observation can otherwise land in both the inner analysis and the inner
assessment set, which makes the design invalid rather than merely
unusual.

## Examples

``` r
data(mtcars)

set.seed(1)
folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3),
  inside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3)
)
folds

#> #  outer: 3-fold cross-validation
#> #  inner: 3-fold cross-validation
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>   splits          id    inner_resamples
#>   <list>          <chr> <list>         
#> 1 <split [21/11]> Fold1 <vfold [3 × 2]>
#> 2 <split [21/11]> Fold2 <vfold [3 × 2]>
#> 3 <split [22/10]> Fold3 <vfold [3 × 2]>

# Each element of inner_resamples is an ordinary rset.
