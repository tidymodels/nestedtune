# Print a nested cross-validation result

Shows the object: its outer folds as the tibble rows they are, the outer
resampling scheme it came from, how many folds did not complete, and a
pointer to
[`summary.nested_results()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/summary.nested_results.md)
for what the run means.

Printing also says when the folds were not choosing from the same menu.
A grid given as a size is expanded per fold, under that fold's own seed,
so a continuous parameter leaves every fold with its own candidates,
which changes how the selections
[`summary.nested_results()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/summary.nested_results.md)
reports should be read. The line reports each fold's candidate count and
appears only when the sets actually differ.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'nested_results'
print(x, ..., n = NULL, width = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `nested_results` object from
  [`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
  or
  [`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md).

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error rather
  than silently ignored, so `n` and `width` must be spelled out in full.

- n:

  Number of rows to show, passed to the tibble printing of the outer
  folds. `NULL`, the default, leaves it to tibble: every row when there
  are fewer than the `print_max` option allows, and otherwise the
  `print_min` option's count with a footer saying how many more there
  are. `Inf` shows every fold.

- width:

  Width of text output to generate for the rows, passed to the tibble
  printing. `NULL`, the default, uses the `width` option. Columns that
  do not fit are listed in the footer under their names.

## Value

`x`, invisibly.

## Examples

``` r
data(mtcars)

rec <- recipes::step_pca(
  recipes::recipe(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars),
  recipes::all_predictors(),
  num_comp = tune::tune()
)
wf <- workflows::workflow(rec, parsnip::linear_reg())

set.seed(1)
folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3),
  inside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3)
)

set.seed(2)
res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = data.frame(num_comp = 1:3))
