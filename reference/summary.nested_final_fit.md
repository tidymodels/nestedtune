# Summarize a final fit

Answers what the final fit means: the full-data tuning run the selection
came from, which procedure ran it and at what counts, how many
candidates that run scored, which parameter values it selected, and
where this model's honest performance estimate lives.

The estimate component is always `NULL`, and that is the point. The
tuning run stored on the object has metrics, but selection consumed them
and they are optimistically biased as a claim about this model; the
nested estimate on the results object the fit was built from – the
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
or
[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md)
result – is the one to report (IP3). The absence is carried as a
component rather than left out, so a caller reading the summary meets a
recorded fact instead of a missing name; the four Bayesian counts are
carried as `NULL` on a grid fit for the same reason.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'nested_final_fit'
summary(object, ...)

# S3 method for class 'summary.nested_final_fit'
print(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A `nested_final_fit` object from
  [`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md).

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error rather
  than silently ignored.

- x:

  A `summary.nested_final_fit` object from `summary.nested_final_fit()`.

## Value

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) returns an object of
class `summary.nested_final_fit`: a list holding the full-data tuning
run's resampling label (`tuning_label`), the tuner that ran (`tuner`:
`"tune_grid"`, `"tune_bayes"`, `"tune_race_anova"`,
`"tune_race_win_loss"`, `"tune_sim_anneal"` or `"fit_resamples"`), the
number of candidates that run scored (`candidates`), the iterating
tuners' counts (`initial` and `initial_requested`,
`iterations_completed` and `iterations_requested`, each `NULL` on a grid
or a racing fit; the scored figures are read from the candidate record,
the requested ones from the procedure, and a run whose candidate record
cannot be derived reports its scored figures as zero rather than failing
to print), the parameter values selection chose (`selection`), and an
`estimate` component that is always `NULL`. A fit built from a
[`nested_fit_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_fit_resamples.md)
result ran no tuning: its `tuning_label` is `NULL`, `candidates` is `0`
and `selection` is empty. Printing it is what most callers want; the
components are there for a caller that needs a value rather than a line
of text.

[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) returns `x`, invisibly.
