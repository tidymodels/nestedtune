# Run the nested cross-validation loop

`nested_tune_grid()` drives the outer loop of nested cross-validation.
For each outer fold it tunes on that fold's inner resamples with
[`tune::tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html),
selects the best candidate, finalizes the workflow, and fits and scores
it on the outer split with
[`tune::last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html).
Every step is delegated to tune; what this function contributes is the
loop, the reproducibility contract, and a results object that keeps each
fold's chosen parameters rather than discarding them.

## Usage

``` r
nested_tune_grid(
  object,
  resamples,
  ...,
  param_info = NULL,
  grid = 10,
  metrics = NULL,
  event_level = "first",
  eval_time = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A
  [`workflows::workflow()`](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/reference/workflow.html)
  with at least one parameter marked for tuning with
  [`tune::tune()`](https://hardhat.tidymodels.org/reference/tune.html).

- resamples:

  A nested resampling design, from
  [`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
  or
  [`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html):
  a data frame whose `splits` column holds one `rsplit` per outer fold,
  whose `inner_resamples` column holds one `rset` with at least one row
  per outer fold, and whose every other column labels the outer folds. A
  label column must be named `id`, or `id` followed by a digit from 1 to
  9 (the names rsample and tune read id columns by), and hold character
  or factor values; taken together, the label columns must give every
  outer fold a distinct label with no `NA`. Inside each inner `rset`,
  every element of its `splits` column is an `rsplit`; all of a fold's
  inner splits carry one frame, either the outer split's own data frame
  (what
  [`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
  builds) or that split's analysis set (what
  [`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
  builds); and an inner split carrying the outer data frame indexes, in
  its `in_id` and any non-`NA` `out_id`, only rows the outer split's
  `in_id` holds, so that no inner analysis or assessment set reaches a
  row the outer fold holds out. A design breaking any of this, or using
  a bootstrap for the outer loop, is refused at the call, before
  anything is fitted, with condition class `nestedtune_bad_design` and
  every offending row, column, inner split or index named. The checks
  exist because
  [`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
  builds a design whatever its `inside` argument returned (a
  specification that produces no `rset`, or an empty one, gives a design
  that cannot be run, where
  [`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
  refuses one at construction), and because a design assembled by hand
  can index rows its outer fold never sees.

- ...:

  A control object as `control` – what
  [`tune::control_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_grid.html)
  returns for `nested_tune_grid()`, what
  [`tune::control_bayes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_bayes.html)
  returns for
  [`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md)
  – and nothing else. It reaches the inner tuning call in every fold,
  and in the final fit, with the slots this package forces overwritten;
  the section on differences from tune says what becomes of each slot.
  Any other name is an error, as is an unnamed value: everything after
  `...` is matched by name, so a mistyped or unsupported argument is an
  error rather than a silent positional match.

- param_info:

  A
  [`dials::parameters()`](https://dials.tidymodels.org/reference/parameters.html)
  object, or `NULL` to let tune derive one from the workflow. Passed
  unchanged to
  [`tune::tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html)
  on every outer fold, so a restricted range restricts the grid every
  fold searches. A parameter whose range is unknown until the data is
  seen (`mtry()`, or a `min_n()` finalized by row count) is finalized by
  tune on the outer fold's analysis rows – never on the rows that fold
  holds out – so on a
  [`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
  design the inner call receives the fold's inner resamples re-pointed
  at its analysis set rather than the design's own `inner_resamples`
  element, which indexes the whole data. A design from
  [`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
  already carries the analysis set and is passed as it is, as is the
  design's element under an outer split that repeats a row (an evaluated
  [`rsample::manual_rset()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/manual_rset.html)),
  where the re-pointing is ambiguous.
  [`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
  finalizes on the full data.

- grid:

  A data frame of candidate parameter values, or a positive whole number
  giving the size of a grid to generate. Passed to
  [`tune::tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html).
  A data frame is checked against the workflow before anything is
  fitted: every column must name a parameter marked with
  [`tune::tune()`](https://hardhat.tidymodels.org/reference/tune.html),
  and every such parameter must have a column.

- metrics:

  A
  [`yardstick::metric_set()`](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/metric_set.html),
  or `NULL` to use tune's defaults for the model's mode. The first
  metric in the set selects the best inner candidate.

- event_level:

  `"first"` (the default) or `"second"`, naming which level of a
  two-class outcome factor is the event. It reaches both loops: the
  inner tuning run, where it decides which candidate is selected, and
  the outer scoring fit, where it decides what the reported metrics
  mean. Metrics that do not distinguish the two levels – accuracy,
  `roc_auc`, `brier_class` – are unaffected by it; `sens`, `spec`,
  `precision` and their relatives are not. Ignored for a regression
  model, as it is in tune.

- eval_time:

  A numeric vector of evaluation times for a censored regression model,
  or `NULL` (the default) to leave the choice to tune. It reaches every
  tune call whose answer depends on it, so a dynamic or integrated
  survival metric – `brier_survival()`, `roc_auc_survival()` and their
  relatives – is measured at the times you name. It is ignored, with a
  warning from tune, whenever the metric set has no metric that reads
  it. tune keys that warning on the metrics rather than on the model's
  mode: a set with no survival metric draws one saying the argument is
  only used for censored regression, and a censored regression model
  scored only by a static metric such as `concordance_survival()` draws
  a different one, saying it is only used for dynamic or integrated
  survival metrics.

  Refused here, ahead of tune: anything that is not numeric, an empty
  vector, and any element that is missing, negative or not finite. tune
  treats those unevenly, and only once a metric reads the times – a
  character value that reads as a number, such as `"1"`, is coerced with
  [`as.numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html) and accepted,
  one that does not becomes missing; a missing, negative or infinite
  element is dropped with a warning; and an empty vector, or one that
  dropping has emptied, aborts – and this package refuses them all at
  entry, before a whole run is paid for. Zero, repeated times and times
  out of order are accepted and passed on untouched, since tune
  normalizes those itself; a repeated time draws tune's warning that 0
  inappropriate evaluation time points were removed, once per tune call.

## Value

An object of class `nested_results`: one row per outer fold, with the
fold's split and id, the metrics scored on its assessment set
(`.metrics`), the parameters chosen for it by inner tuning
(`.selected`), the inner tuning run's own metrics (`.inner_metrics`),
whether the fold finished (`.completed`), anything that went wrong
(`.notes`), and the two seeds that reproduce it (`.tuning_seed`,
`.outer_fit_seed`). Use
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
to summarize.

**Two records describe the grid, and they answer different questions.**
`attr(x, "grid")` holds the `grid` argument **as it was given**: a
positive whole number, not a table of candidates, whenever a size was
passed. The `.inner_metrics` column holds what each outer fold's inner
tuning actually scored:
[`tune::collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
of that fold's tuning run, one table per fold with a column per tuned
parameter, one row per candidate and metric, and tune's `.metric`,
`.estimator`, `mean`, `n`, `std_err` and `.config` columns, with
`.eval_time` beside them when a dynamic survival metric was scored. The
candidates a fold searched are the table's distinct parameter rows.
Ranking those rows on one metric by `mean` reproduces the fold's
`.selected` except where candidates tie, which
[`tune::select_best()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/show_best.html)
resolved on the inner run in its own order; `.selected` records the
candidate the fold's outer fit used.

The two diverge routinely, in both directions. A size is expanded by
tune and may reach fewer candidates than were asked for (a request for
20 on a parameter with four reachable values evaluates four), and a
candidate that fails scores nothing. Folds can also differ from *each
other*: expanding a size draws from the generator, and each fold tunes
under its own seed, so a continuous parameter gives every fold its own
candidates. Printing says so when it happens.

One limit is worth stating plainly. `.inner_metrics` is tune's summary
of the tuning run, and a candidate that failed on **every** inner
resample scored nothing: it has no row there. `.notes` is where its
failure is recorded. A candidate that failed on some inner resamples and
scored on others has its rows, with `n` below the inner resample count.
A fold that scored no candidate at all carries a zero-row table with a
completed fold's columns, never `NULL`.

`attr(x, "metrics")` holds the `metrics` argument, and is absent rather
than `NULL` when none was supplied. `.inner_metrics` is a column, so it
travels with the fold it describes.

The `procedure` record, which
[`extract_procedure()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/extract_procedure.md)
returns, records what ran, on the result of every orchestrator: a named
list giving the tuner (`"tune_grid"` here, `"tune_bayes"` from
[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md),
`"tune_race_anova"` or `"tune_race_win_loss"` from
[`nested_tune_race_anova()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_race.md)
and its sibling, `"tune_sim_anneal"` from
[`nested_tune_sim_anneal()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_sim_anneal.md)),
that tuner's own arguments (`grid` here and for the racers; `iter`,
`initial` and `objective` for the Bayesian tuner, `iter` and `initial`
for annealing), and `param_info`, `event_level` and `eval_time` on all.
A Bayesian result carries the `procedure` record and no `grid`
attribute, and its `.inner_metrics` tables carry an `.iter` column;
[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md)
documents both.

**What an operation on the object may and may not do.** The result
carries the invariants `tune` declares on its own results objects:

- rows may be reordered, but never added or removed;

- columns may be added or reordered;

- every column listed above must still be present, holding the values it
  held.

The columns the run is recorded in are the ones the resampling design
named, and `nested_tune_grid()` records them when it builds the result.
So a column you add afterwards is read as a fold label only when the
design itself carries a column of that name: `id`, and `id2` for a
repeated design. The name you pick decides nothing on its own: adding
`id2` to a result from a plain v-fold design leaves the class, the
record and the fold labels alone, exactly as adding `extra` does.

An operation that stays inside those rules (`arrange()`, `mutate()`
adding a column, a join that matches one row apiece) returns a
`nested_results` with the call's record intact. Anything else
(`slice()`, a [`filter()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html) that
drops a fold, `bind_rows()`, `x[1, ]`, dropping one of the columns
above) returns a bare tibble, with the record removed along with the
class. A three-row object cannot honestly describe itself as the
ten-fold design it was cut from, so it stops describing itself at all
and hands back the data.

It is one rule, reached through four doors. dplyr's verbs and `[` reach
it through a `dplyr_reconstruct()` method; **vctrs**' own verbs
(`vec_slice()`, `vec_rbind()`, `vec_c()`, `vec_cbind()`, `vec_ptype()`
and `vec_cast()`) reach it through `vec_restore()`; and
[`rbind()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cbind.html) and `rename()`, which
reach neither generic, have methods of their own. So `rbind(x, x)` and a
`rename()` that moves one of the columns above hand back a bare tibble,
the same answer `slice()` gives, rather than an object whose record has
stopped describing its own rows.

Combining is the one place the doors part. `vctrs::vec_rbind(x)` and
`vctrs::vec_c(x)` hand back a bare tibble even with nothing to combine
`x` with, where `dplyr::bind_rows(x)` returns a `nested_results`: vctrs
asks for the common type before it asks the rule anything, and the
common type of one results object is a plain table. Every combination of
two or more returns a bare tibble through either door, which is the rule
above.

Column-binding is the one place argument order shows. `bind_cols()` and
`vec_cbind()` both build their answer on the first argument's type, so
`bind_cols(x, extra)` and `vec_cbind(x, extra)` are a `nested_results`
while `bind_cols(extra, x)` and `vec_cbind(extra, x)` are plain tibbles
holding the same ten columns. Either verb answers the same way in either
position.

Three verbs sit outside all of it. `group_by()`, `rowwise()` and
[`tibble::as_tibble()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/as_tibble.html)
return a grouped, a rowwise and a plain tibble respectively (none of
them a `nested_results`), and each carries the attributes across, so
`attr(dplyr::group_by(x, id), "outer_label")` still answers with the
run's scheme. Nothing they hand back claims to be a results object; the
record is along for the ride.

## Details

The estimate this returns describes the whole tune-and-fit *procedure*,
not any single fitted model. It is not the performance of a model you
can deploy, and no final model is returned here: build that with
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md),
which takes this result and runs the procedure it recorded again with
the whole dataset in hand. The estimate from this function is what you
report for it.

For a Bayesian inner loop –
[`tune::tune_bayes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_bayes.html)
proposing candidates one at a time – see
[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md);
for a raced grid – finetune eliminating candidates as the inner
resamples come in – see
[`nested_tune_race_anova()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_race.md)
and
[`nested_tune_race_win_loss()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_race.md);
and for simulated annealing – finetune perturbing the current candidate
one iteration at a time – see
[`nested_tune_sim_anneal()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_sim_anneal.md).
Each runs this same outer loop with the inner tuner swapped.

## Reproducibility

Seed the session before the call, as elsewhere in tidymodels; there is
no `seed` argument. On entry the function draws `2 * n` seeds in a
single `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2 * n)` call, where `n` is the
number of outer folds. Fold `i` uses element `2 * i - 1` for its tuning
step and element `2 * i` for its outer fit, each applied with the
generator kind pinned. Because a fold's seed depends on its position and
not on the order folds are executed in, the result is the same however
the loop is scheduled.

This makes any single fold reproducible by hand. Fold `i` is exactly (on
a
[`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
design, `resamples$inner_resamples[[i]]` here stands for that inner rset
re-pointed at `analysis(resamples$splits[[i]])` – the frame each inner
split carries is the fold's analysis set, its indices remapped – which
changes the call only when `param_info` carries an unknown range,
finalized on those rows as `param_info` describes):

    set.seed(res$.tuning_seed[[i]], kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
             normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
    tuned <- tune_grid(object, resamples$inner_resamples[[i]], grid = grid,
                       metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time,
                       control = extract_procedure(res)$control)
    final <- finalize_workflow(object, select_best(tuned, metric = <first metric>))
    set.seed(res$.outer_fit_seed[[i]], kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
             normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
    last_fit(final, resamples$splits[[i]], metrics = metrics,
             eval_time = eval_time,
             control = control_last_fit(event_level = event_level))

The caller's RNG state and generator kind are restored on exit,
including when the call errors, so a seeded script that draws afterwards
is unaffected: the same contract
[`tune::tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html)
gives. One consequence worth knowing: two consecutive calls with no
[`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) between them return
identical results, exactly as repeated `tune_grid()` calls do.

This binds randomness that flows through R's generator. Engines that
randomize outside it (kernlab's SVMs, the deep-learning engines) cannot
be pinned by any R-side scheme, here or in tune.

## When a fold fails

A fold that fails does not end the run. The remaining folds still run,
and the fold that failed is recorded rather than discarded: `.completed`
is `FALSE` for it and `.notes` holds what went wrong, in the same shape
tune uses: one row naming the stage that failed (`"inner tuning"` or
`"outer fit"`), followed by tune's own notes about the underlying cause.
The number of folds attempted and the number completed are stored on the
object as the `folds_attempted` and `folds_completed` attributes.

Both stages can fail quietly. Inner tuning raises only once every
candidate has failed, and the outer fit does not raise at all: it hands
back a result with no metrics. Both are recorded as failures here.

A fold can also complete *and* carry notes. When only some of a fold's
inner resamples fail, tuning still returns a candidate and the fold
finishes, but its parameters were chosen on less of the inner design
than was asked for. Those notes are kept, so `.completed` being `TRUE`
with a non-empty `.notes` means exactly that: it worked, on less than
the whole design.

A failed fold still records the candidates it got as far as scoring,
whatever stage it failed at. A fold that died at the outer fit had
already tuned, so its `.inner_metrics` holds the full table, and so does
one that tuned successfully and then failed while selecting from the
results. Only a fold that never reached a scored candidate at all
(tuning itself raised, or every candidate failed) holds a zero-row
table. No fold is reported as having searched a grid it did not.

Any operation outside the invariants stated under **Value** above
returns a bare tibble, and both counts go with the class rather than
being recomputed for whatever rows are left. Dropping the `.completed`
column is one such operation.

The run warns when it finishes with any fold unfinished, and
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
warns again, summarizing only the folds that ran and reporting how many
those were. It refuses outright when no fold completed: an estimate is
never reported for a design that did not execute.

## Parallel execution

The outer folds run in parallel when you have started mirai daemons, and
serially otherwise. There is no argument for this: start daemons before
the call and the loop uses them:

    mirai::daemons(4)
    res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)
    mirai::daemons(0)

Two or more daemons are needed before the loop dispatches; below that it
stays serial, the same threshold `tune` applies. Inner tuning always
runs serially whatever you set, because nested parallelism
oversubscribes cores.

**Results do not depend on how the loop ran.** The same seed gives the
same result serially and in parallel, at any number of daemons: each
fold's seeds are drawn up front and assigned by position, so a fold's
outcome depends on where it sits in the design and never on which worker
took it or in what order. One exception, and it carries no numbers: the
backtraces stored in `.notes` record where a fold executed, so a fold
that failed on a daemon carries that daemon's call stack rather than
yours. The note text, its location, and its type are the same either
way, though a daemon wraps long message lines to its own console width
rather than your terminal's.

**Each fold is sent one copy of the data, not one per inner split.** A
resampling split carries the whole frame it indexes, and sending a fold
to a daemon means serializing it, which does not preserve the single
shared copy the design holds in memory. Each fold's splits are therefore
emptied before dispatch and refilled on the worker, so what crosses is
the fold's row indices plus one copy of the data rather than one copy
per split. On a design built by
[`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
that is one copy per fold; a design from
[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
materializes an analysis frame per outer fold, so each fold also carries
its own, still once rather than once per inner split.

Two things this does not reach, both of them objects you supply rather
than anything the package builds. A recipe keeps a copy of the data it
was created with, and a formula carries the environment it was written
in, so a workflow built inside a function that holds a large object
sends that object with every fold. Building the workflow at the top
level avoids the second.

Daemons are **separate R processes**, which has consequences worth
knowing:

- They do not inherit your session's options, your
  [`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html) changes, or
  environment variables you set after launching them. Set what a fold
  needs with
  [`mirai::everywhere()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/reference/everywhere.html),
  or start the daemons after setting it.

- They load nestedtune from an installed library. Running under
  `devtools::load_all()` is not enough: the daemons cannot see it, and
  the call stops rather than failing every fold with the same opaque
  note. During development, prime them with
  `mirai::everywhere(pkgload::load_all("<path>"))`.

- Before dispatching, the call asks **every** connected daemon whether
  it can load the package, and stops if any of them cannot. A pool whose
  daemons differ (one respawned, or started against a different library)
  therefore fails here, naming how many are affected, rather than as a
  run in which some folds come back as opaque worker failures.

- The same round trip asks each daemon which of this session's internal
  functions its own copy of the package defines, and stops if any are
  missing. A daemon holding an *older install* loads the package
  perfectly well and then fails every fold, because the worker resolves
  what it needs by name inside that daemon's copy. The error names the
  missing functions and asks you to reinstall and then restart the pool:
  a running daemon keeps the namespace it has already loaded, so
  reinstalling underneath one changes nothing until it is replaced.

- The same round trip also asks every daemon for each package the
  workflow and the tuner need (the engine's, a recipe step's, and for a
  race the package its model is fitted with), and stops when one daemon
  cannot load one of them, naming how many daemons are affected and
  which packages. Install them into the daemons' library and restart the
  pool.

- A daemon that does not answer at all is reported as a non-response,
  not as a missing package, so a merely slow daemon is never met with
  advice to install what you already have. The check waits 30 seconds by
  default; set `options(nestedtune.preflight_timeout = <milliseconds>)`
  to raise or lower that, to a single positive, finite number. Nothing
  statistical depends on it.

- The first parallel call after starting daemons is the slow one: the
  check is what makes every daemon load the package, and the whole
  tidymodels stack is not cheap to load. Because the check now waits for
  *all* of them rather than whichever answers first, a cold pool on a
  loaded machine can need more than the default 30 seconds; raise the
  option if you see a non-response you do not believe. Later calls in
  the same session reuse what the daemons already loaded.

- That check is bounded; the folds themselves are not. If every daemon
  dies *after* folds are dispatched, the call blocks waiting for results
  that will never arrive, and you interrupt it. No per-fold timeout is
  imposed, because no time limit is defensible for an arbitrary model
  fit: a slow fold and a dead one would be indistinguishable.

A fold whose worker dies is recorded as a failed fold, exactly like any
other failure: the run finishes, the other folds keep their results, and
`.notes` names the worker as the stage.

Stopping a run is not a fold failure. A fold that was never given a
chance to run has not been attempted, so recording it as one would
describe a design that did not execute. Stopping the dispatched tasks
therefore aborts the call and returns nothing, raising a
`nestedtune_cancelled` condition. That class inherits from
`nestedtune_interrupted`, which is what a task interrupted on its own
daemon raises, so a handler for the general case catches both and one
that cares can tell them apart. Either way the caller's RNG state is
restored on the way out.

Interrupting the call at your own console is not one of these. It
unwinds the blocking wait before any worker's return value is
classified, so an ordinary interrupt propagates and no nestedtune
condition class is attached: the RNG state is still restored, but do not
write a handler expecting one.

An interrupt also asks the folds it leaves behind to stop. However the
call is left once its folds are dispatched (an interrupt, or an error),
the outstanding ones are cancelled on the way out, so the pool goes idle
shortly after rather than computing folds whose results nobody will
read. Two limits are worth knowing. Cancelling needs mirai's dispatcher,
which `mirai::daemons(n)` starts by default; on a pool started with
`dispatcher = FALSE` the request cannot reach the workers at all and the
folds run to completion. You are told so at dispatch rather than left to
discover it: such a pool raises a warning of class
`nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable`, once per call, naming the remedy. The
pool is not refused, because its results are correct: what it lacks is
the ability to stop. And stopping is a request rather than a guarantee:
a fold already inside a compiled fitting routine may not be
interruptible, and one that has nearly finished may simply finish.

One case cannot be told apart, and is documented rather than guessed at:
calling `mirai::daemons(0)` while folds are outstanding produces exactly
the value a daemon dying mid-fold produces: same code, same classes,
nothing to separate them. Tearing the pool down that way is therefore
recorded as fold failures rather than treated as a cancellation, because
the alternative would discard every completed fold whenever a single
worker died.

## Differences from calling tune directly

There is no `control` formal, but a
[`tune::control_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_grid.html)
passed through `...` as `control` reaches the inner `tune_grid()` in
every fold, and in the final fit that re-runs the result. What runs is
the control passed, or tune's default when none is, with the slots this
package forces overwritten; the result records that effective control as
`extract_procedure(res)$control`, which is what the recipe above passes.
Every slot of `control_grid()` falls under one of seven headings.

**Forced: `allow_par`.** Both tune calls a fold makes – the inner tuning
run and the outer scoring fit – run at `allow_par = FALSE`, whatever the
control carries. Parallelism belongs over the outer folds, as above, and
leaving that to a caller would put two pools in contention.

**Settable as its own argument: `event_level`.** The argument reaches
the inner `control_grid()` and the outer `control_last_fit()` alike, and
is the one place the level is set: a control left at tune's default
takes the argument's level, and a control naming a level that is neither
tune's default nor the argument's is refused at entry, naming both.
`eval_time` is offered the same way, though it is not a control slot in
tune either – it is an argument of both `tune_grid()` and `last_fit()` –
and for the same reason: it changes a number the caller is shown.

**Refused: none.** No slot is refused on its own. What is refused at
entry is a control of another class – a `control_bayes()`, which tune
itself would accept here – and the `event_level` conflict above. The
class is the contract: tune gives
[`tune::control_resamples()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_grid.html)
and
[`tune::control_last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/control_last_fit.html)
the `control_grid` class, so either is accepted as what `control_grid()`
returns, its slots read under these headings.

**Passed through: `verbose`, `pkgs`, `parallel_over`, `workflow_size`.**
Each reaches `tune_grid()` as given. `verbose` prints from a serial run,
beside the progress the outer loop reports, and from a mirai daemon
where nothing shows it. `pkgs` is required before fitting on the serial
path as on the parallel one, where the daemon pre-flight has already
required this package's namespace in every worker. `parallel_over` is
not inert at `allow_par = FALSE`: it still chooses how tune loops over
resamples and candidates, and with it the seed each model fit starts
from, so a stochastic engine's numbers differ between `"resamples"` and
`"everything"`; left `NULL`, tune takes `"resamples"` when there is more
than one inner resample. `workflow_size` is the size past which tune
remarks on a workflow `save_workflow` keeps, so it speaks only beside
that slot, and only where the run it lands on is kept.

**Kept from the outer fit: `save_pred`, `extract`.** Each reaches the
outer scoring fit as well as the inner run. With `save_pred = TRUE` the
result carries a `.predictions` list column, each completed fold's
predictions on its assessment rows as
[`tune::last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html)
returns them; with `extract` a function, an `.extracts` list column, the
function's value on each completed fold's fitted workflow, applied after
the fit. A failed fold holds `NULL` in each, and a fold whose extract
errored stays completed with `NULL` there and a note at location
`"outer extract"`.
[`collect_predictions()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.nested_results.md)
and
[`collect_extracts()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.nested_results.md)
stack the two columns with the fold labels. What is kept is the outer
fit's; the inner run's predictions and extracts, which the same slots
save inside tune, are still discarded with that run, and neither column
exists on a run that did not ask.

**Not returned: `save_workflow`.** It lands on the inner `tune_results`,
which a fold record discards once the fold succeeds, so on a nested run
setting it costs the work and returns nothing; `extract = function(x) x`
keeps a fold's fitted workflow instead. The final fit is the exception:
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
re-runs the recorded control and keeps its tuning run as `$tuning`,
where
[`extract_tune_results()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/extract_tune_results.md)
reaches what it saved.

**Inert: `backend_options`.** Options for a parallel backend, with no
backend to reach at `allow_par = FALSE`.

Not passed on: `select_best()` is called without `eval_time`. Left unset
it selects at the first of the evaluation times the tuning run was built
with, which are the ones named here, so naming them twice would change
no choice and would repeat tune's message about which time it took.
