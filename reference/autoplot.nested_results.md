# Plot a nested cross-validation result

Two views of a `nested_results` object, both drawing one point per outer
fold with the folds in design order.

`type = "parameters"`, the default, shows what each outer fold's inner
tuning selected. A flat row of points means the folds agreed; points at
different heights mean they disagreed, and the tuning procedure is
unstable on this data, which averaging the metrics hides. This is the
view nothing else in the ecosystem offers.

`type = "performance"` shows each outer fold's score on its held-out
assessment set, with a rule at the nested estimate: the same value
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
reports.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'nested_results'
autoplot(object, type = c("parameters", "performance"), ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A `nested_results` object from
  [`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
  or
  [`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md).

- type:

  Which view to draw: `"parameters"` (the default) or `"performance"`.

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error rather
  than silently ignored.

## Value

A `ggplot` object.

## Details

An outer fold that failed keeps its place on the x axis and draws no
point, as does a fold that completed without recording a value for a
parameter. Neither is imputed and neither is dropped from the axis, so
the shortfall is visible in the figure itself. A run in which no fold
completed is refused with condition class
`nestedtune_no_completed_folds`, as
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html),
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md)
and
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
refuse it.

The subtitle states how much of the requested design ran. Contribution
is counted per panel instead, because it differs between them: a panel
says so when fewer folds contributed to it than completed, as in
`mtry (2 of 3 chose)` or `rmse (from 2 folds)`; an unqualified panel
means every completed fold contributed. A requested metric that no
completed fold could score keeps an empty panel rather than
disappearing.

The selected-value axis is numeric when every value drawn is a number,
and discrete otherwise: a single axis cannot be both, and
character-valued tuning parameters are ordinary. A fold that selected
`NA` is a value on that discrete axis rather than an absent point.

rec <- recipes::step_pca(
  recipes::recipe(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars),
  recipes::all_predictors(),
  num_comp = tune::tune()
)
wf <- workflows::workflow(rec, parsnip::linear_reg())

set.seed(1)
folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3),
  inside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3)
)

set.seed(2)
res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = data.frame(num_comp = 1:3))

autoplot(res)

autoplot(res, type = "performance")
```
