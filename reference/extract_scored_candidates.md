# Extract the candidates a final fit actually scored

Returns the candidate parameter settings that
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)'s
tuning run actually evaluated: the full-data counterpart of the
candidate set each outer fold's `.inner_metrics` table describes on a
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
or
[`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md)
result, derived the same way from the run's
[`tune::collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
table, so a Bayesian final fit's table carries the `.iter` column that
path's tables do.

## Usage

``` r
extract_scored_candidates(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `nested_final_fit` object from
  [`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md).

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error rather
  than silently ignored.

## Value

A tibble with one row per candidate scored, carrying one column per
tuned parameter plus tune's `.config` label for the candidate, and
`.iter` on a Bayesian fit. It is the distinct parameter rows of the
run's
[`tune::collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
table with those labels: the same shape one element of a result's
`.inner_metrics` column reduces to when its metric columns are dropped,
so the two can be compared directly. Everything tune wrote per metric is
dropped: `.metric`, `.estimator`, `mean`, `n`, `std_err`, and on a fit
that scored a dynamic survival metric the `.eval_time` column, so a
candidate has one row here however many evaluation times it was scored
at. The times and the scores are in
`collect_metrics(extract_tune_results(x))`. A fit built from a
[`nested_fit_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_fit_resamples.md)
result scored no candidate and is refused with condition class
`nestedtune_no_tuning_run`.

This is what was **scored**, not what was **asked for**. A `grid` given
as a size is expanded by tune and may reach fewer candidates than the
number requested; a candidate that failed everywhere scored nothing. See
the `.inner_metrics` discussion in
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
for the full account of how the two records diverge, which holds here
too: this record is derived the same way.

One pointer there does **not** carry over. A candidate that failed on
every inner resample is missing from this table, and on a
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
result its failure is recorded in that object's `.notes` column. A
`nested_final_fit` has no such column. Look instead inside the tuning
run itself: `tune::collect_notes(extract_tune_results(x))`.

  inside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 3)
)

set.seed(2)
