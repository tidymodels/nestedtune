# Collect the metrics from a nested resampling run

Collect the metrics from a nested resampling run

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'nested_results'
collect_metrics(x, ..., summarize = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `nested_results` object from
  [`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
  or
  [`nested_tune_bayes()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_bayes.md).

- ...:

  Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error rather
  than silently ignored.

- summarize:

  Whether to average the per-fold metrics (`TRUE`, the default) or
  return them one row per outer fold (`FALSE`).

## Value

A tibble. Summarized, one row per metric – and, for a metric measured at
evaluation times, per evaluation time – with the mean across outer
folds, the number of folds contributing, and the standard error of that
mean. Unsummarized, one row per outer fold and metric – and per
evaluation time, where a metric was measured at several. Both carry a
`.eval_time` column exactly when the run was scored by a dynamic or
integrated survival metric, as tune's own
[`collect_metrics()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/collect_predictions.html)
does; on a static metric's row beside one, it is `NA`.

## Details

The summarized value is the nested cross-validation estimate: what the
tune-and-fit procedure achieves on data it never saw. It is not the
performance of any model you have in hand.

Only the outer folds that completed are summarized, and `n` counts the
folds contributing to each row, so a run with failures never reports its
estimate as though the whole design had run. Those folds are dropped
with a warning naming them; when no fold completed at all, this errors
instead of returning `NA`, with condition class
`nestedtune_no_completed_folds` – the class
[autoplot()](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/autoplot.nested_results.md),
[`agreement()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/agreement.md)
and
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
refuse such an object with.

A metric measured at several evaluation times (`eval_time` on
[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md))
is summarized per time, never averaged across them: each row's `mean` is
over the fold estimates at the time it names.

## Reading `std_err`

`std_err` is the standard error of the mean across outer folds: the
standard deviation of the per-fold scores divided by the square root of
how many there were. It is the precision of that mean, not the
fold-to-fold spread, which is larger by the same square-root factor. It
is **not** a confidence interval for the estimate, and one should not be
built from it.

That is a limit of the statistics rather than of this implementation.
Outer fold scores are not independent (any two folds share most of their
training rows), so a standard error computed as though they were can
misstate the uncertainty, typically downward. Bengio and Grandvalet
(2004) proved there is no universally unbiased estimator of a k-fold
cross-validation estimate's variance to put in its place. Gauran, Ombao
and Yu (2025) measured what that costs inside a nested design: several
of their test statistics built on a variance-based denominator rejected
a true null far more often than the nominal 5% they were run at (36% and
40% in the worst cells they report), and they recommend against such
denominators outright.

Both results are about closely related quantities rather than this
column exactly: Bengio and Grandvalet study the variance of a k-fold
estimate built from per-observation losses, and Gauran and colleagues
work inside ridge and LASSO designs. Neither gap rescues the column: no
interval here is oracle-backed, which is the practical point.

The column is reported because `tune` reports it and users expect the
shape; no inferential claim is made with it.
