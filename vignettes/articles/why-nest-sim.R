# Produces `vignettes/articles/why-nest.rds`, the stored result the site-only
# article `vignettes/articles/why-nest.Rmd` ("Why nest: a simulation") reads.
#
# The design follows Varma and Simon (2006), `cairn/references/varma2006.md`:
# data with no signal, so the true accuracy of any classifier is the null
# accuracy by construction, features far outnumbering rows, a learner tuned
# over a grid. Each replicate draws a fresh dataset, tunes the same workflow
# twice on it, and keeps two numbers: the best candidate's mean accuracy from
# a flat `tune::tune_grid()` run, which is the number a tuning run reports as
# its winner's score, and the nested estimate from `nested_tune_grid()`, which
# scores each outer fold's winner on rows its tuning never saw.
#
# The store carries the design, the seed, the null accuracy, the tolerance the
# article holds the nested median to, the commit and the date. The commit and
# the date are provenance and change between runs; everything else is a
# function of the seed, so two runs from the same seed write the same object
# once those two fields are removed.
#
# Run from the package root, with the package and nnet installed:
#
#   Rscript vignettes/articles/why-nest-sim.R
#
# Serially, one replicate takes about 80 seconds on a 2026 laptop, so the
# default of 30 replicates runs for about 40 minutes. The script is under
# `vignettes/articles/`, which `.Rbuildignore` excludes, so neither the
# tarball nor the pkgdown build runs it; the article reads the store.
