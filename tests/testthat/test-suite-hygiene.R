# Hygiene checks on the test suite's own source.
#
# One rule, and it exists because breaking it costs twenty minutes of silence
# rather than a red test: every wait on a mirai result in this suite goes
# through `collect_bounded()` (helper-parallel.R), which polls to a deadline and
# then reads `$data`. Everything else mirai offers for getting a value out
# blocks until it resolves and cannot be interrupted from R at all --
# `setTimeLimit(elapsed=)` does not fire inside any of them, established by
# execution while planning M14.
#
# Three shapes are matched, and the list is the enumeration this check is only
# as good as (M14 review F1, which found the first draft matched one of them):
#   * `collect_mirai(x)` -- collects a whole map.
#   * `call_mirai(x)` -- mirai's canonical blocking wait; `x[]` is sugar for it.
#   * a `[` collect, empty (`mirai(...)[]`, `map[]`) or carrying one of mirai's
#     collect options (`map[.flat]`, `map[.progress]`, `map[.stop]`), which
#     block just as hard as the empty form.
#
# Checked over parse tokens rather than by grepping text, so a `[]` inside a
# string and the several comments that discuss `map[]` and `collect_mirai()` by
# name are not findings. A comment describing the trap is the opposite of the
# trap.

# mirai's collect options, as of 2.7.2. A new one added upstream is invisible
# to this check until it is named here -- which is the honest limit of an
# allowlist, and preferable to flagging every `x[.anything]` in the suite.

# The second rule (M16 T3, AC3): every wait-shaped call in the daemon files is
# accounted for in the time budget. `collect_bounded()` made the waits bounded;
# this makes the SUM of those bounds visible, which is the part that killed a CI
# job -- 1008.7 s of legal waiting in a file that normally takes 12.0 s, against
# a 20-minute cap.
#
# Accounted for is not the same as small. A call that waits for nothing carries a
# 0-second row saying why, and that is the point: adding a new call forces a
# conscious classification instead of letting it hide among the harmless ones.
