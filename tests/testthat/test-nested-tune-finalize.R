# Oracle records for the frame an inner tuning call finalizes an unknown

#
# O1 -- type "analytic" (closed form). Source: dials::get_n_frac_range(), whose
#   finalized range is `floor(nrow(x) * frac)` of the frame it is handed (dials
#   1.4.x, read 2026-09-03), so a candidate the fold searched is inside
#   `floor(n * c(1/10, 5/10))` computed here from that fold's own
#   `nrow(rsample::analysis(split))` -- and outside it, by up to 20 on the
#   200-row fixture, when tune reads the full frame instead. Pinned by "AC2:
#   every candidate a fold searched lies inside the range its analysis rows
#   finalize".
#
# O2 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: rsample::nested_cv()
#   built under the same seed, whose inner splits carry each outer fold's
#   analysis set as their own frame, so tune finalizes on it by construction.
#   Pinned by "AC3: a nested_resamples() design and the nested_cv() design it
#   matches tune identically", which asserts the inner rows identical first.
#
# O1 and O2 are the >=2 independent oracle types GP2 requires. AC1 is the
# row-identity assertion behind both: the frame every finalizer call is handed
# is one outer fold's analysis frame and no other rows.

# The fixture: a 200-row frame, five outer folds of four inner folds, so each
# fold's analysis set holds 160 rows. Inner v = 4 clears the racers' burn-in
# floor (R/checks.R, `check_race_burn_in()`); the `inside` arguments are
# literal (the M05 lesson).
