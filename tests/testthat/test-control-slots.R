# Every slot of tune's two control objects is classified on the help page of
# the orchestrator it reaches (M48, AC6): under exactly one of seven headings --
# forced, settable as its own argument, refused, passed through, kept from the
# outer fit (M68), not returned, inert.
#
# The classification is read off the rendered help rather than off a list kept
# here, and the slot names come from `formals()` of tune's own functions, so a
# slot tune adds fails here by name until the page classifies it, and a slot
# the page names under two headings fails as the duplicate it is. The section
# writes each heading as bold text opening with the heading word and a colon
# and carrying the slot names in code -- `**Forced: `allow_par`.**` -- and the
# parse is of exactly that shape: a `\strong` node's text up to the colon is
# the heading, its `\code` children are the slots. Prose outside the bold may
# name any slot it likes.
