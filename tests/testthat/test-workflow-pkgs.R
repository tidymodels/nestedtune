# The host's entry check reads the workflow's whole package list (M58, AC4).
#
# Before M58 the check asked `parsnip::required_pkgs()` of the engine alone,
# so a recipe step whose `required_pkgs()` names a package this library lacks
# reached the first fold and failed there, one fit later than the engine's
# refusal. The check now asks `tune::required_pkgs()` of the workflow -- the
# list the daemon pre-flight and the attach step read -- and refuses under the
# class the tuner refusal carries, with an install call the user can paste.
#
# The fixture is a step with no prep or bake of its own: nothing here fits,
# because the refusal fires at entry, and `required_pkgs()` is the only method
# the check consults. The method is registered on the generic's own namespace,
# where S3 dispatch from `recipes:::required_pkgs.recipe()` finds it.
