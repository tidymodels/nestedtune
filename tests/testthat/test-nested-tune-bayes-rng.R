# Gaussian-process seed is the fold's tuning seed, and the control carrying it
# is built inside that seed's scope. Every test that could pass vacuously under
# a deterministic engine uses ranger, whose fits draw from R's RNG; the
# proposals themselves draw too, through tune's own `set.seed(control$seed +
# i)` calls, which is what the seed rule fixes.
