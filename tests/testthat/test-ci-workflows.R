# The publishing step needs a git working tree it does not create by itself.
#
# `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` runs `git config user.name` inside the
# workspace before it does anything else, so a job that only unpacks an artifact
# into an otherwise empty runner directory dies with `fatal: not in a git
# directory`. That is what the first run of `pkgdown.yaml` on the default branch
# did: every pull-request run before it was green because the step's `if:` guard
# skips deploying off that branch, so it had never once executed.
#
# `pkgdown.yaml` builds and deploys in two jobs, `build` and `deploy`, so the
# checkout the deploy step needs is `deploy`'s own first step rather than a step
# of the job that built the site. The assertion is the same one either way: a
# checkout precedes the deploy action in the steps the job runs.
#
# `.github/` is `.Rbuildignore`d, so this file has nothing to read when the suite
# runs from a built tarball and skips there. It runs under `devtools::test()` in
# the source tree, which is where a workflow is edited in the first place.

# dependency of this package and adding one to assert a property of two lines
# would cost more than the check is worth. The boundary is findable this way
# only below `jobs:`, where job names are the sole keys at two-space indent
# carrying no value -- above it, `on:`'s `push:` and `pull_request:` look
# identical, which is why the search starts there and not at line one.
