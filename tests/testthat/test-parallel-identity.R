# reference-loop oracle in test-nested-tune-grid-oracles.R to stay green
# alongside them. Neither replaces the other: that one anchors what the numbers
# are, these anchor that the numbers do not depend on how the loop was run.
#
# Every test uses the ranger workflow. With a deterministic engine these pass
# vacuously -- RR03 re-confirmed M02's lesson by executing a wrong dispatcher
# against the PCA/lm workflow and watching it pass.
