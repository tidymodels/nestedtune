# Oracle records for the two racing exports (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are
# recorded in the test file that asserts them). The numbering is this file's
# own.
#
# O1 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: the tidymodels and
#   finetune pipeline itself, recomputed at test time by
#   reference_nested_race_loop() in helper-orchestration.R, written from the
#   documented seed contract -- `set.seed(s)`, one
#   `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2 * n)`, fold i racing under element
#   2i-1 with the kind pinned and `control_race(burn_in = 2, allow_par =
#   FALSE)`, fitting under element 2i -- and never from the driver's output.
#   Pinned by "per-fold metrics, selections and inner tables match a
#   hand-rolled racing reference loop" on the deterministic and the
#   metric-separating fixtures, for each racer. Satisfies AC1.
#
# O2 -- type "invariant". Source: no external one; the agreement between two
#   independent internal routes is the oracle. A candidate a race scored on
#   every inner resample was scored on exactly the resamples `tune_grid()`
#   scores it on, so its `mean` must equal the grid orchestrator's for the
#   same candidate under the same seed and the same explicit grid; the race
#   shuffles the resample order, and the means agreed to the last bit on
#   every fold of the fixture under two seeds (measured 2026-09-02, finetune
#   1.3.0). Pinned by "a candidate raced to the end carries the grid path's
#   mean". Satisfies AC2.
#
# O3 -- type "live", on the record's derivation (D-043, IP4): a fold's
#   `.inner_metrics` is `collect_metrics(<the race>, all_configs = TRUE)`,
#   eliminated candidates included, and `.selected` is `select_best()` on the
#   race; on the stochastic fixture a race eliminates at least one candidate,
#   so a table with a candidate at `n` below the resample count is shown, and
#   the selection is a candidate raced to the end. Pinned by "the fold record
#   is every candidate the race scored, and the selection a survivor".
#   Satisfies AC3.
#
# O4 -- type "invariant" (mode independence), pinned in
#   test-parallel-identity.R as BC12: the same seed gives an identical result
#   serially and at two daemon counts. Recorded here for the audit.
#
# O1 and O2 are the >=2 independent oracle types GP2 asks of the package's own
# contribution -- the call, the seed, the record, the loop. The elimination
# itself is finetune's, inside D-002's boundary, and no independent oracle for
# it exists here.
