# IP2 -- reproducible results. M02 ships no parallelism, so there is no backend
# to exercise the "regardless of workers" half of IP2. What is checkable
# serially is that a fold's result depends on its position and its seeds and on
# nothing else: not on the order folds run in, not on the RNG state or
# generator kind that happens to be active when a fold starts. Those are the
# conditions a fresh worker process presents, simulated in one session (RR01
# Q8). Every test that could pass vacuously under a deterministic engine uses
# ranger instead, whose fits draw from R's RNG.
