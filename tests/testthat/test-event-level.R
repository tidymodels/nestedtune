# Oracle records (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are recorded in the test file
# that asserts them).
#
# O1 -- type "closed-form". Source: the definition of sensitivity, the share of
#   true events the model called events, recomputed here with explicit code
#   from a refit of the fold's selected candidate. Nothing from `tune` computes
#   it, and `yardstick::sens_vec()` is read beside it as a second reading of
#   the same predictions. Pinned by "AC2: the sensitivity each outer fold
#   reports is the one yardstick computes at that event level".
#
# O2 -- type "live" (independent implementation). Source: a `tune::tune_grid()`
#   the test runs itself under `control_grid(allow_par = FALSE, event_level =
#   "second")`, seeded by the by-hand recipe documented at
#   `R/nested-final-fit.R:106-118` -- the object's own `tuning_seed`,
#   kind-pinned, with the inner rset built inside that seed's scope. Pinned by
#   "AC4: nested_final_fit() tunes under the caller's event level".
#
# O3 -- type "invariant". Source: two internal routes that must agree -- on a
#   two-class outcome, sensitivity at one event level is specificity at the
#   other, so the same run at the two settings has to exchange them. Pinned by
#   "AC3: the two levels exchange sensitivity and specificity".
#
# The factor level a caller can name as the event (M35).
#
# Everything here runs on the cls_* fixture (helper-orchestration.R), which is
# built so the setting has something to move: an imbalanced two-class outcome
# with the event first, stratified splits so no assessment set is single-class,
# and a metric set led by `roc_auc` so selection is level-invariant while
# `sens` and `spec` carry the difference. The first test asserts the fixture
# still has those properties -- without it the difference clauses below would
# pass vacuously on a fixture that had drifted.
