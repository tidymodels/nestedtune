# Oracle records for nested_final_fit() (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are
# recorded in the test file that asserts them).
#
# O3 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: the tidymodels pipeline
#   itself, recomputed at test time by reference_final_fit() in
#   helper-orchestration.R, which is written from the documented seed contract
#   (D-011, D-016) and never from the returned object -- it derives its own
#   seeds, builds its own inner rset under the first of them, and spells out the
#   inner specification rather than reading the design's. Pinned by "the final
#   fit matches a hand-rolled reference pipeline". Satisfies AC2/AC9.
#
# O4 -- type "invariant". Source: no external one; the agreement between two
#   independent internal routes is the oracle. With a single-candidate grid
#   there is nothing to select, so the tuning stage cannot influence the result
#   and the final fit must equal a direct fit of the workflow finalized on that
#   one candidate. Pinned by "a single-candidate grid degenerates to a direct
#   fit". Satisfies AC2. Deterministic engine, so the equality is exact rather
#   than seed-contingent (D-013).
#
# O5 -- type "live" (independent reference implementation), the third strand
#   RR02 recommended. Source: tune's own fit_best(), tidymodels' separately
#   written "select, finalize, and fit on everything" path -- code neither this
#   package nor this test author wrote. Pinned by "the final fit matches
#   tune::fit_best() on the same tuning run". Needs save_workflow = TRUE on the
#   test's own tune_grid() call, which is why reference_final_fit() sets it.
#
# O3 and O4 are the >=2 independent oracle types GP2 requires; O5 reduces the
# exposure the first two share by routing the finalize-and-fit tail through
# upstream code.
#
# M46 (D-041): the final fit reads its procedure off the results object, so
# every reference here is fed the recorded procedure -- `attr(res,
# "procedure")` and `attr(res, "metrics")` -- rather than the values the test
# happens to know. The Bayesian path adds:
#
# O3b -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source:
#   reference_bayes_final_fit() in helper-orchestration.R, written from the
#   documented seed contract and D-040's rule that the Gaussian process is
#   seeded from the tuning seed through `control_bayes(seed = )` built after
#   `set.seed()` on that number, the initial set drawn inside that call from
#   the same stream, the rset built inside the seed's scope (D-016). Pinned by
#   "the Bayesian final fit matches a hand-rolled reference pipeline".
#   Satisfies AC2.
#
# O4b -- type "invariant". Source: the agreement between two internal routes.
#   At `iter = 0` a Bayesian run scores its initial candidates and proposes
#   nothing, so the final fit of that result must equal the final fit of a
#   grid result on the grid those candidates form -- the same design, the
#   same entry seed -- `dials::grid_space_filling()` on the two-parameter
#   fixture being seed-independent (asserted, as test-nested-tune-bayes-oracles.R
#   does). Pinned by "at iter = 0 the Bayesian final fit is the grid final fit
#   on the space-filling grid". Satisfies AC3.
#
# O5 (Bayesian strand) -- `tune::fit_best()` on the reference's own
#   `tune_bayes()` run, built with `save_workflow = TRUE` on the test's own
#   tuner call (RR02 Q5, RR05 Q1: tune refuses `fit_best()` on a run stored
#   without it, and the package's controls never set it), run under the
#   independently derived fit seed with the kind pinned. The reference run is
#   asserted identical to the final fit's stored run on selection and `in_id`
#   splits in the AC2 strand above it. Weaker than the grid strand, since
#   `fit_best()` never runs `tune_bayes()`; it pins that `select_best()` on an
#   `.iter`-bearing run picks the row the package picked, and routes the tail
#   through upstream code. Satisfies AC3's second clause.
