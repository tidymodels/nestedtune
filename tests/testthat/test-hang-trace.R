# the reporter's choice, and the choice is the whole difference between a log
# that names the block a killed job died in and one that names nothing: without
# live updates a file's events are replayed in one burst when the file
# finishes, so a file that hangs prints no line at all. So the assertions here
# are on the mode, not merely on the lines.

# A fixture directory of two files, one holding a block that sleeps, run under
# the runner's own composite reporter with two workers. `package = "testthat"`
# because a worker must `library()` something and the fixture is not a
# package; nothing else about the run depends on which package that is.
