# Oracle records (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are recorded in the test file
# that asserts them). The file opens with the fixture's own properties, which
# are asserted rather than assumed because every comparison below is vacuous
# without them.
#
# O1 -- type "closed-form". Source: the definition of the IPCW Brier score --
#   the mean over the held-out rows of w_i * (1{T_i > t} - S_hat(t | x_i))^2,
#   with Graf's inverse-probability-of-censoring weights built here from a
#   reverse Kaplan-Meier of the censoring distribution fitted on the fold's own
#   analysis rows (`survival::survfit(Surv(time, 1 - event) ~ 1)`), evaluated at
#   `min(T_i, t)` and zero for a row censored before `t`. Nothing from `tune`
#   or `yardstick` computes it; `yardstick::brier_survival()` is read beside it
#   as a second reading of the same predictions. Pinned by "AC2: the metric each
#   outer fold reports at the named evaluation time is the IPCW Brier score".
#
# O2 -- type "live" (independent implementation). Source: a `tune::tune_grid()`
#   plus `tune::last_fit()` the test runs itself from the fold's own
#   `inner_resamples` and split, seeded by the recipe `nested_fold_fit()`
#   follows -- the fold's recorded `.tuning_seed` then its `.outer_fit_seed`,
#   both kind-pinned -- at the same evaluation time. Pinned by "AC3: each run's
#   per-fold metrics are the ones tune produces at that evaluation time", and in
#   its final-fit form by "AC4: nested_final_fit() tunes and selects under the
#   caller's evaluation time".
#
# O3 -- type "invariant". Source: two internal routes that must agree -- a run
#   at a multi-element `eval_time` and a run at that vector's first element have
#   to select the same candidate and report the same number at that element,
#   because `tune:::first_eval_time()` takes element one either way. Pinned by
#   "AC3: a multi-element evaluation time reports what its first element names".

# The evaluation times a censored-regression metric is measured at (M41).
#
# Everything here runs on the srv_* fixture (helper-orchestration.R), built so
# `eval_time` has something to move: a mixture of early failures no log-normal
# can reproduce and a long tail no exponential can match, so the grid's three
# distributions rank differently at the fixture's early time than at its late
# one. The first tests assert the fixture still has those properties -- without
# them a run at either time would agree with a run at the other for reasons
# having nothing to do with whether the argument was forwarded.
