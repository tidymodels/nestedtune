# so every test passing it asserts nothing about `metrics` reaching tune: drop
# the argument anywhere and the run is identical. This fixture exists to make
# that argument observable, and it needs two properties at once.
#
# The metric names must differ from the default's, so the outer `.metrics` from
# last_fit() changes -- hence `mae`, which is not in `metric_set(rmse, rsq)`.
# And the *selection* must differ, so `.selected` changes when the inner
# tune_grid() loses the argument and select_best() falls back to resolving
# `rmse` off the tuned object. That second property is not free: on
# make_reg_data() every candidate metric picks the same number of components,
# which is exactly why the shared fixture cannot do this job.
#
# Heavy-tailed noise is what earns it. mae is robust to outliers and rmse is
# not, so the two rank candidates differently once the residuals stop being
# Gaussian. The (data seed, design seed) pair below was found by searching that
# space at the OUTER-FOLD level -- a whole-data proxy reports separation the
# nested design does not have -- and separates in all three outer folds.
#
# The model path is RNG-free (PCA and lm), but the fixture itself is not: the
# all-three-folds separation is a property of one seed pair under one generator
# triple, and a bare set.seed() pins only the uniform generator. Measured at
# M18 review: under `normal.kind = "Box-Muller"` separation falls to 1 of 3
# folds, and under `RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")` or `sample.kind = "Rounding"` to
# 0 of 3 -- so an ambient kind left set by another file would make the metric
# tests fail for a reason that has nothing to do with `metrics`. Both helpers
# therefore pin the full triple the way reference_nested_loop() does, and
# restore the caller's kinds so the pin does not leak into the next test.

# `event_level` names a factor level, so nothing in the regression fixtures
# above can exercise it. Three things this one has to get right.
#
# The outcome is deliberately imbalanced, 32 events against 88, with the event
# the FIRST level -- so `event_level = "first"` is the interesting case rather
# than a formality, and so sensitivity and specificity separate. At a 50/50
# outcome a symmetric classifier scores them close together and the difference
# clauses AC2 and AC4 rest on would be measuring noise.
#
# Both the outer and the inner splits are stratified on the outcome. With 32
# events across three folds each assessment set holds ten or eleven of them, so
# no assessment set is single-class -- which is what sensitivity being NA would
# otherwise mean, and what would take `select_best()` down with it. 32/88 at
# v = 3 is also above rsample's pooling threshold, so stratifying here raises
# no warning.
#
# The metric set leads with `roc_auc`. `select_best()` resolves its metric from
# the tuned object's first metric name, and `roc_auc` returns byte-identical
# values at the two event levels -- so selection is level-invariant and the two
# runs score the same candidate, which is what makes AC3's swap an identity

# The suite-level fixture cache (M12).
#
# Most of this suite's runtime went on building the same tuning run over and
# over -- one file alone asked for a byte-identical `nested_tune_grid()` result
# seventeen times. `memoised()` wraps such a call so the run is built once per
# worker process and every later request for the same run in that process is
# served from the cache. The cache is an environment in the process that built
# it: under parallel test files (M52) each worker holds its own, so a fixture
# two files share is built once in each worker that runs one of them, and a
# serial run builds it once. Nothing about what a test asserts changes; only
# how many times the fit happens.
#
# "The same run" means the whole of it. The key is a hash of the canonical form
# (below) of every argument the call passes, plus the RNG state in force once
# those arguments have been forced -- which is exactly the state the orchestrator
# itself will snapshot, because `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()`
# both force every argument in their `check_*()` calls before they touch the
# RNG. Change the workflow, the design, the grid, the metrics or the seed and
# the key changes with it.
#
# Do NOT wrap a call made under `local_mocked_bindings()`: the mock is not in
# the key, so a value built under a mock would then be served to an unmocked
# request. test-nested-tune-grid-leakage.R calls the orchestrator directly for
# exactly that reason.

# The canonical form of a value: what it *is*, with environments read for their
# contents rather than their identity.
#
# `rlang::hash()` on its own cannot key this cache. Two identically-constructed
# workflows serialize to different bytes, and so do two `metric_set()` calls: a
# recipe's `terms` quosures capture the frame that built the recipe, and that
# frame holds the recipe itself, while `metric_set()`'s closure environment
# refers to itself the same way. Serialization resolves those cycles by
# reference, and the reference numbering does not survive re-construction.
#
# So environments are expanded by their contents, sorted so that binding order
# cannot enter; a named environment -- a namespace, the global environment --
# stands for its name, since its contents are not what distinguishes one fixture
# from another; and a cycle is cut the second time it is reached. Everything
# else keeps its value and its attributes, which is what keeps the form
# discriminating rather than merely stable. test-fixture-cache.R pins the
# per-argument half of that: for every formal argument the two orchestrators
# declare, read from `formals()` at test time, it asserts that two requests
# differing only in that argument key differently. The attribute and
# environment clauses above are not what that test exercises -- its variants
# differ from the base request in class or top-level value -- so a change to
# either clause leaves it green (measured 2026-09-01 at M42).

# The function goes in as a value, not as the text that named it: the cache is
# shared across every file in one `test_dir()` run, so keying on the source text
# alone would let two files that memoise same-named local builders collide, and

# a different fixture. Exposed on its own so test-fixture-cache.R can check what
# it separates without building anything.
#
# A request is refused, not keyed, when any argument's canonical form reaches
# `canonical_form()`'s depth cut: past the cut the form is truncated, so two
# arguments differing only below it would share a key and one test would be
# served the other's fixture. Every fixture family this suite builds sits well
# inside the cut (the sorted argument list the guard forms reaches 30 levels
# for the `det`, `sep` and `unstable` requests, against a cut of 40, measured
# 2026-09-01 at M42), so a hit means a new fixture shape, and the remedy is
# raising the cut rather than hashing a truncated form. The refusal names each
# deep argument by name, or by its position in the request when it has none:
# `memoised()` names every argument `match.call()` matches, so a bare position
# means a direct `fixture_key()` call or a value that landed in `...`.
