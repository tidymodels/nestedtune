# a capture asserts the harness saw the value, not that tune acted on it, and a
# mocked binding never reaches a mirai daemon at all (plan gate, 2026-08-30).
# What is asserted instead is the one thing forwarding buys -- a restricted
# range restricts the grid every fold searches -- with the unrestricted run
# beside it as the control that shows the restriction is doing the work.
