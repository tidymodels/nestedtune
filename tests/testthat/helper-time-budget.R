# What the daemon tests are allowed to wait for, declared (M16 T2, AC2).
#
# The problem this exists to make visible. `test-parallel-classify.R` typically
# runs in 12.0 s (benchmarks/test-timing-baseline.md), but before M16 its
# declared waits permitted 1008.7 s. On 2026-07-27 a CI job sat in that file for
# ~17 minutes and was killed by the 20-minute cap, and the surviving log said
# only that it had started the file (PR #13, run 30303761053). A wedge and a
# file running its own worst case are indistinguishable from the outside -- so
# the worst case is written down here, and kept smaller than the cap.
#
# THE SUMMING CONVENTION, which is a decision and not an accident (M16 plan
# gate): each wait contributes ITS OWN declared seconds. An enclosing
# `setTimeLimit()` never caps that contribution, because M14 established by
# execution that `setTimeLimit()` does not interrupt a blocked mirai wait -- it
# is not a bound on the path that actually stalls, and crediting it would
# flatter every total here exactly where the flattery is unsafe. Those calls get
# rows carrying 0 seconds so the guard can see they were classified, never
# because they are free.
#
# A call that does no waiting also gets a 0-second row rather than no row:
# `check_daemons_can_load(status)` on a fabricated `preflight_outcome()`
# classifies an answer already in hand and dispatches nothing. Recording it is
# what makes `test-suite-hygiene.R`'s guard able to insist that EVERY wait-shaped
# call is accounted for -- a new one cannot land silently by looking like the
# many harmless ones.
#
# HOW A ROW'S SECONDS ARE KEPT HONEST, which is two different mechanisms and was
# once described here as one (M16 review F3, scored 85).
#
# Rows whose bound lives in helper-parallel.R read the constant itself --
# COLLECT_BOUNDED_DEFAULT_S, START_DAEMONS_BOUND_S(), MIXED_DAEMONS_BOUND_S --
# so cutting a bound there moves the ledger with it and those cannot drift.
#
# The rest carry a literal copied from an explicit argument at the call site
# (`daemons_load_status(timeout = 1000L)` and friends), and a copy can drift:
# raising the real argument while leaving the row alone would leave every guard
# green and the printed total unchanged. So `test-suite-hygiene.R` re-reads each
# such argument from the source and fails when the row disagrees.
#
# What that cross-check cannot reach is declared here rather than left implicit,
# because an unstated exemption is how the first version of this comment came to
# overclaim. Three kinds escape it: a bound read from a named constant, which
# cannot drift and needs no re-read; a bound set through the OPTION at one line
# and spent at another (classify:760 sets it, :766 spends it); and a wait that is
# no function call at all (the deadline poll in interrupt). None carries an
# explicit bound argument in the call itself, which is exactly how the
# cross-check recognises them.
#
# Those exemptions are now DECLARED and asserted, not merely described here.
# `test-suite-hygiene.R` keeps the list as DECLARED_UNCHECKABLE_BOUNDS and fails
# when the set of rows it could not re-read differs from it -- so a fourth
# exemption has to be argued for rather than acquired by writing a call the
# regex cannot parse. Prose alone was not enough: this paragraph said the gap was
# on the record while a row wrapped across two lines sat in it unnoticed (M24
# review F9).

# One site's worst case: what it waits for, times the number of times the
# surrounding code runs it. `times` is 1 unless a loop says otherwise -- the
# start_daemons() call in test-parallel-identity.R:38 sits inside
# `for (n in c(2L, 3L))` and is therefore paid twice.
