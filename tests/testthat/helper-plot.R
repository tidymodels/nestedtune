# point dropped by a scale or absent for want of a value is missing from the
# built layer and present in the data. Pixels are pinned separately, by vdiffr.

# The drawn points, keyed by the fold label their x position stands for and the
# panel they sit in. A discrete x is built as an integer index into the scale's
# labels, so the lookup is what turns a position back into a fold.
