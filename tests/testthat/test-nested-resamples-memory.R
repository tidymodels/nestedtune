#
#   O1  type      live -- an independent implementation recomputed at test time
#       source    rsample::nested_cv(), recomputed here rather than frozen
#       asserts   that the per-outer-fold size slope is far shallower than
#                 rsample's, in `the size slope is far shallower ...` below
#
#   O2  type      closed-form -- a storage model recomputed with explicit
#                 arithmetic, independent of the implementation under test
#       source    derived in `analytic_size()` below from what the structure
#                 must hold: one shared copy of the data, the outer splits'
#                 index vectors, and the inner splits' index vectors. The
#                 inner term charges both an analysis and an assessment index
#                 because splits indexing the whole data cannot derive the
#                 complement -- rsample's inner splits can leave `out_id = NA`
#                 only because they index a frame that already *is* the
#                 analysis set.
#       asserts   the measured size at every v, in `measured size matches the
