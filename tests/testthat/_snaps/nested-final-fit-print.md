      Procedure: grid search, 3 candidates scored
      Selected: num_comp = 3
      
      i Report the nested estimate from `collect_metrics()` on the results object
        this fit was built from. For a fit built from a workflow set, that is this
        workflow's rows of `collect_metrics()` on the set. That holds for a workflow
        chosen before seeing the set's estimates. It describes the procedure that
        produced this model, and it is the number to report for this model.
      i Compare the parameters above with `.selected` from that run. Outer folds
        choosing differently is selection instability, and it is information about
        the procedure rather than noise.
      i `extract_tune_results()` returns the tuning run selection came from, and
        `extract_scored_candidates()` the candidates it scored. Any metric reachable
        through the first is a selection-time quantity, optimistically biased as a
        claim about this model.
