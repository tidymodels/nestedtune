# stood at d6ff85f, and re-agreed at M46 (below).
#
# Written out here rather than left to the snapshot below it. The snapshot is
# exactly the artifact a change to the print method would re-record, so a
# criterion forbidding that output to change cannot be pinned to it -- accepting
# the new snapshot would satisfy the pin and falsify the promise at the same
# time. These bytes have to be re-agreed by hand instead.
#
# M46 added a "Procedure:" line -- what search ran, grid or Bayesian, and at
# what counts -- and pointed the estimate sentence at the results object
# rather than naming `nested_tune_grid()`, since the record it reads from can
# equally be a `nested_tune_bayes()` result. That is a change to what this
# constant pins, re-agreed by hand rather than accepted from the snapshot for
# the same reason the original was.
