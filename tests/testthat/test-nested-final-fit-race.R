# The final fit on a racing result (M50 AC6, T5): `nested_final_fit()` races
# the recorded grid again on the full data, and everything it reports about
# that race reads through the same derivation the fold record uses.
#
# O5 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source:
#   reference_race_final_fit() in helper-orchestration.R, written from the
#   documented contract -- its own `set.seed(s)` and
#   `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2)`, the inner rset built under the
#   first seed (D-016), the race under `control_race(burn_in = 2, allow_par =
#   FALSE)`, `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()` under the second
#   -- and never from the object. Pinned by "the racing final fit matches a
#   hand-rolled reference pipeline", for each racer, on the stochastic
#   fixture so a mis-seeded fit cannot agree by accident.
