# Oracle records (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are recorded in the test file
# that asserts them).
#
# O1 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: the tidymodels pipeline
#   itself, recomputed at test time by reference_nested_loop() in
#   helper-orchestration.R, which is written from the documented seed contract
#   rather than from the driver. The same oracle test-nested-tune-grid-oracles.R
#   records; asserted here on the sep_* fixture with `metric_name = "mae"`, so
#   it pins the metric the inner tuning selected under. Pinned by
#   "nested_tune_grid() selects under the metrics it was given".
#
# The `metrics` argument reaches tune (M18).
#
# Nothing here asserted anything before M18: the suite's shared metric set is
# `metric_set(rmse, rsq)`, which IS tune's regression default, so every test
# passing it produced a run identical to one passing nothing. Deleting the
# argument from any call site left the suite green.
#
# These tests run on sep_* (helper-orchestration.R), a fixture built so that the
# caller's metric set and tune's default disagree about both the metric names
# and the selected candidate. The disagreement is the whole instrument, so the
# first test below asserts the fixture still has it -- without that, the other
# two would pass vacuously against a future tune whose defaults had changed,
# which is the failure mode this file exists to prevent.
