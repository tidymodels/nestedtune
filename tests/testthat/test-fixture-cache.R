# The suite-level fixture cache (M12).
#
# The cache exists to stop the suite rebuilding the same tuning run dozens of
# times, and it is only safe if a served result is indistinguishable from a
# fresh build. Two things have to hold for that, and both are asserted here: a
# hit returns the same value, conditions and RNG state a build would, and the
# key separates two requests that differ in any one orchestrator argument.
#
# The second is the one with teeth. A key that fails to separate two distinct
# fixtures does not raise anything -- it quietly hands one test another test's
# run, and the test still passes. So the separation is checked per argument,
# over the formals `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` declare at
# test time, rather than over a list of signatures someone remembered to write.

# A stand-in for the orchestrator: cheap, and net-zero on the RNG exactly as
# `nested_tune_grid()` and `nested_final_fit()` are (D-011). Nothing here fits a
# model -- what is under test is the cache, not the loop.
#
# The build counter lives in the global environment rather than in this file's,
# and that is not fastidiousness. `memoised()` keys on the canonical form of the
# builder itself, which expands the builder's lexical environment; a counter
# sitting in `fake_fit()`'s own scope would therefore change the key every time
# it ticked, and the cache would never hit. Named environments -- a namespace,
# the global environment -- are taken by their name instead of expanded, so a
# counter kept there is invisible to the key. The real builders are package
# functions whose environment is the nestedtune namespace, which is why they are
# stable for exactly the same reason.
