# Oracle records for nested_tune_bayes() (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are
# recorded in the test file that asserts them). The numbering is this file's
# own; test-nested-tune-grid-oracles.R keeps its O1-O4 for the grid path.
#
# O1 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: the tidymodels
#   pipeline itself, recomputed at test time by reference_nested_bayes_loop()
#   in helper-orchestration.R, written from the documented seed contract --
#   `set.seed(s)`, one `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2 * n)`, fold i
#   tuning under element 2i-1 with the kind pinned and `control_bayes(seed =
#   <that element>, allow_par = FALSE)`, fitting under element 2i -- and never
#   from the driver's output. Pinned by "per-fold metrics and selections match
#   a hand-rolled Bayesian reference loop" (deterministic) and "the Bayesian
#   reference loop also matches with a stochastic engine". Satisfies AC2.
#
# O2 -- type "invariant". Source: no external one; the agreement between two
#   independent internal routes is the oracle. At `iter = 0` a Bayesian run
#   scores its initial candidates and proposes nothing, so it must equal
#   nested_tune_grid() on the grid those candidates form. The fixture has two
#   integer-valued parameters, and for two or more parameters
#   dials::grid_space_filling() returns sfd's precomputed design -- the same
#   rows in the same order under every seed, with no draw (measured
#   2026-09-01, dials 1.4.4; a single parameter is drawn from the stream and
#   differs across seeds) -- so one grid built outside the loop is what every
#   fold's Bayesian run scored. Pinned by "at iter = 0 the Bayesian path is the
#   grid path on the space-filling grid". Satisfies AC3.
#
# O3 -- type "invariant" (mode independence), pinned in
#   test-parallel-identity.R as BC10: the same seed gives an identical result
#   serially and at two daemon counts. Recorded here for the audit; the
#   assertion lives with the other dispatch identities.
#
# O4 -- type "live" (reference implementation), M48. Source: the same
#   reference loop, handed the caller's `control_bayes()` and applying the
#   documented merge -- `allow_par` off, the fold's tuning seed as `seed`,
#   every other slot as passed. Pinned by "a control passed through `...`
#   reaches every fold". The discriminator is the early stop `no_improve = 2`
#   produces on the fixture: two of three folds record five candidates
#   against the seven `initial + iter` would give, and the same run with no
#   control records seven in every fold (measured 2026-09-02, tune 2.1.0).
#   Satisfies M48 AC1.
#
# O1 and O2 are the >=2 independent oracle types GP2 asks of the package's own
# contribution -- the call, the seed, the record, the loop -- at the initial
# stage. The iteration stage has O1 and O3 only: the proposals are tune's own
# Gaussian-process search inside D-002's boundary, and no independent oracle
# for them exists here or in a review brief (plan gate, 2026-09-01).
