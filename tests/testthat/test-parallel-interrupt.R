# Leaving dispatch_folds() without returning stops the folds it dispatched (M15).
#
# The defect: dispatch_folds() sends a mirai_map and then blocks in
# collect_mirai(). Interrupting there unwinds the host, but says nothing to the
# daemons -- so the pool the user reuses next is still computing folds whose
# results nobody will ever read. Established by execution against mirai 2.7.2
# before the fix: a real SIGINT during the collect left
# `mirai::status()$mirai` reporting `executing = 2`.
#
# The folds here are stand-ins that mark themselves started and then sleep. A
# real fit would make the window the interrupt has to land in depend on how
# fast the machine fits, and what is under test is the fate of dispatched work,
# not fitting (M12). The stand-in is installed by mocking the package's own
# `fold_task`, which dispatch_folds() looks up by name -- so everything from
# `mirai_map()` to the return is the production path.

# A fold record's shape, built inline rather than by calling a helper: the task
# is serialized to a daemon with its environment stripped to the global one, so
# its body can reach nothing this file defines.
