# The record a Bayesian run leaves (M45 T2, AC5; M49): each fold's

# candidate and metric, with the `.iter` a Bayesian run adds. Built by hand so
# the derivation can be asserted on a shape whose answer is known without a
# fit -- a candidate scored under two metrics, one proposed in iteration 1,
# and a table with no iteration column at all.
