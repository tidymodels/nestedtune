# What crosses to a worker (M23).
#
# The defect these pin: an rsplit carries the whole data frame, and R's
# serializer does not preserve the sharing that makes the in-memory design lean.
# Every split in a fold's payload therefore wrote its own copy -- six of them for
# v = 5, inner_v = 5 -- so `lobstr::obj_size()` reported 946.94 kB for something
# that put 5,141,166 B on the wire. An in-memory size assertion cannot see this
# at all, which is why the oracles below measure the serialized stream.
#
# Oracle records (validation doctrine; DESIGN.md Conventions declares that they
# live beside the asserting test):
#
#   O1  type      closed-form -- a storage model recomputed with explicit
#                 arithmetic, independent of the implementation under test
#       source    `predicted_lean_bytes()` in helper-payload-size.R, derived
#                 from n / v / inner_v alone and never from lengths read off the
#                 payload, so a lost inner split cannot shrink measurement and
#                 prediction together
#       asserts   the leaned payload's serialized size, in `a leaned payload
#                 weighs what the index vectors alone predict` below
#
#   O2  type      invariant -- a direct count of the property claimed, sharing
#                 no arithmetic with O1
#       source    `count_data_copies()` in helper-payload-size.R, searching the
#                 serialized stream for the big-endian wire bytes of a data
#                 column
#       asserts   that a fold's dispatch carries the data exactly once, in `a
#                 fold's dispatch carries the data exactly once` and in the
#                 rsample-design test below
#
# O1 and O2 are the two independent types GP2 requires for the size claim, and
# together they are what the roxygen claim on `nested_tune_grid()` rests on.
#
# The baseline every ratio here is measured against is RECOMPUTED, never frozen:
# each test builds the pre-milestone fat payload beside the lean one and
# compares. A frozen byte count would drift the first time rsample changed its
# split representation, and would then fail for a reason that has nothing to do
# with this package.

# `fixture_design()` moved to helper-payload-size.R at M26, so a benchmark can
# source it. It lived here, in a test file nothing outside testthat can source,
# which is why benchmarks/probe-mori-dispatch.R re-typed the design by hand and
# then attributed its figures to a definition it had never called.

# The payload shape M23 replaced: split and inner rset passed whole.
