# MEANS -- the design, the failures and their stages, the selections, the
# estimate. A fact asserted against the wrong one of those would pass today and
# stop meaning anything the moment either method moved.
#
# The snapshots at the bottom pin the shapes that carry meaning. The assertions
# above them pin the facts a snapshot alone would let drift silently: an
# approved snapshot records whatever the code printed, not what it owed, so a
# criterion that must hold is asserted in words as well as recorded in shape.

# The summary's rendered text, for the assertions below. Wrapped because a
# partial run warns by design (AC3) and the warning is asserted where it is the
# subject, not in every block that reads the text.
