# Oracle records for nested_tune_grid() (DESIGN Conventions: oracles are
# recorded in the test file that asserts them).
#
# O1 -- type "live" (reference implementation). Source: the tidymodels pipeline
#   itself, recomputed at test time by reference_nested_loop() in
#   helper-orchestration.R, which is written from the documented seed contract
#   rather than from the driver. Pinned by "per-fold metrics and selections
#   match a hand-rolled reference loop" (deterministic and stochastic variants).
#   Satisfies AC2/AC16.
#
# O2 -- type "invariant". Source: no external one; the agreement between two
#   independent internal routes is the oracle. With a single-candidate grid
#   there is nothing to select, so nested CV must degenerate to ordinary CV and
#   per-fold metrics must equal tune::fit_resamples() on the same outer rset.
#   Pinned by "a single-candidate grid degenerates to fit_resamples()".
#   Satisfies AC3/AC17. Deterministic engine only, per RR01 B2: matching
#   fit_resamples() with a stochastic engine would require replicating tune's
#   internal substream derivation.
#
# O1 and O2 are the >=2 independent oracle types GP2 requires for the nested
# estimate.
#
# O3 -- type "live" (reference implementation), for the evaluated-candidate
#   record rather than for the estimate (M21). Source: tune::tune_grid() itself,
#   re-run by hand on a fold's own inner resamples under that fold's
#   `.tuning_seed` with the generator kind pinned, exactly as the roxygen's
#   by-hand reproduction recipe prescribes. Pinned by "an integer grid records
#   the candidates that fold actually expanded". A tune_results carries no
#   record of its own expansion -- attributes are `parameters`, `metrics`,
#   `outcomes`, `rset_info` and nothing else (measured at M21's plan gate,
#   tune 2.1.0) -- so re-running is the only route to an independent answer.
#
# O4 -- type "invariant", the companion to O3 on the branch O3 cannot reach: a
#   data-frame grid must come back as itself, since nothing expands. Pinned in
#   test-nested-tune-grid-results.R ("each fold records the candidates its inner
#   tuning actually scored"). O3 and O4 are the two independent types covering
#   the record.
#
# OBSERVED, NOT ASSERTED (M21). On tune 2.1.0, integer-grid expansion is
# stochastic for a continuous parameter, so folds tuning under their own seeds
# search different candidate sets. Measured on the fixture the O3 test below
# builds -- cont_workflow(), grid = 5, seeds 11 and 20 -- the three outer folds
# expanded thresholds:
#
#   fold 1: 0.00059 0.24510 0.50336 0.74564 0.98373
#   fold 2: 0.03347 0.25516 0.49639 0.75686 0.99656
#   fold 3: 0.00259 0.23142 0.48026 0.74269 0.99798
#
# This is why the record is a column and not one attribute: no single value
# describes what this run searched. It is recorded rather than asserted because
# it is a property of tune's expansion, which IP2 declines to guarantee across
# tune versions -- asserting it would turn a correct package red on an upstream
# change. The O3 test below asserts the part that IS this package's contract:
# each fold's record matches what that fold ran.
