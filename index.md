# nestedtune

Nested cross-validation for the tidymodels ecosystem.

Start with [Nested
cross-validation](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.html),
which walks from a nested design to a write-up. Then read [What the
estimate
means](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/estimate.html): which
quantity the nested number estimates, what to report instead of your
model’s own score, and how to read disagreement between outer folds.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/nestedtune")
```

## Building a nested resampling design

[`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
builds the same structure as
[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html):
an outer resampling with an inner resampling attached to each outer
fold, without keeping a copy of the data for every outer fold.

``` r

library(nestedtune)

set.seed(1)
folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 5),
  inside = rsample::vfold_cv(v = 5)
)

folds$inner_resamples[[1]]
```

For the same seed and the same specifications the splits select the same
rows as rsample’s:
[`analysis()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/as.data.frame.rsplit.html)
and
[`assessment()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/as.data.frame.rsplit.html)
return identical frames, and each inner split carries the same class and
resample id, so anything dispatching on those keeps working. What
differs is what the splits point at: the original data rather than a
materialized copy per outer fold.

## Why

[`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html)
evaluates the inner specification against `as.data.frame(split)`, so
every outer fold’s inner resamples reference their own materialized copy
of that fold’s analysis set. Object size therefore grows by roughly one
copy of the data per outer fold
([rsample#283](https://github.com/tidymodels/rsample/issues/283)).

[`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md)
evaluates the inner specification against the same frame, keeps only the
row indices it produces, and remaps them onto the original data.
Measured on
[`mlbench::LetterRecognition`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mlbench/man/LetterRecognition.html)
(20000 × 17) with a five-fold inner resampling, as multiples of the
source data size:

| outer folds | [`rsample::nested_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_cv.html) | [`nested_resamples()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_resamples.md) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 2.2× | 1.2× |
| 5 | 5.6× | 1.7× |
| 10 | 11.4× | 2.6× |
| 50 | 57.5× | 10.0× |

What remains is the index vectors, which rsample stores too; the copies
of the data are gone.

## Running the nested loop

[`nested_tune_grid()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_tune_grid.md)
tunes on each outer fold’s inner resamples, selects, fits on the outer
analysis set, and scores on the outer assessment set, keeping what each
fold chose.
[`nested_final_fit()`](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/reference/nested_final_fit.md)
takes that result and runs the procedure it recorded once more with the
whole dataset in hand, and gives back the model to deploy as its own
object.

``` r

library(nestedtune)
library(parsnip)
library(rsample)
library(workflows)

wf <- workflow(
  mpg ~ .,
  rand_forest(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune()) |>
    set_engine("ranger") |>
    set_mode("regression")
)
grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2L, 5L, 8L), min_n = c(2L, 10L))

set.seed(1)
folds <- nested_resamples(
  mtcars,
  outside = vfold_cv(v = 5),
  inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)
)

# The estimate: what the whole tune-and-fit procedure achieves. Report this.
set.seed(2)
res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)
collect_metrics(res)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 5
#>   .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err
#>   <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
#> 1 rmse    standard   2.46      5  0.445 
#> 2 rsq     standard   0.844     5  0.0267

# The model: what you deploy. It has no performance number of its own.
set.seed(3)
final <- nested_final_fit(wf, res)
predict(final, new_data = mtcars[1:3, ])
#> # A tibble: 3 × 1
#>   .pred
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  20.9
#> 2  20.9
#> 3  23.8
```

What to write up is the subject of [the
guide](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/nested-cv.html). Why
the estimate belongs to the procedure rather than to the model is the
subject of [What the estimate
means](https://nestedtune.tidymodels.org/articles/estimate.html).
