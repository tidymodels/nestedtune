# The named doors onto what selection saw.
#
# `nested_final_fit` has carried its tuning run since M05, reachable only as an
# undocumented list slot; D-014 shipped `extract_workflow()` and left this one
# as "a documented slot suffices pre-1.0" (RR02 Q7). D-023 gives it a name, and
# gives one to the candidate set that run scored -- the final fit's equivalent
# of the candidate set each fold's `.inner_metrics` describes on
# `nested_results` (M21's column, replaced at M49), derived by the same
# function from the run's metrics table so the two can never describe the
# same thing differently.
#
# Generics rather than plain functions: the `extract_*` family is generic
# everywhere in tidymodels, so a non-generic would leave no room for a second
# class to answer. They are generics this package OWNS rather than borrows,
# which is new here -- `collect_metrics()`, `extract_workflow()` and
# `autoplot()` are all methods on someone else's -- and it is forced: neither
# tune nor hardhat defines either name (verified 2026-07-30, tune 2.1.0), so
# there is no upstream generic to register against.
#
# Both carry a default method because R's bare "no applicable method" names
# neither what was handed over nor what would have answered. tune reaches for
# the same remedy on `show_best()` (M06).

#' Extract the tuning run a final fit was selected from
#'
#' Returns the [tune::tune_grid()] or [tune::tune_bayes()] result that

#' @return The stored `tune_results` object, unchanged. It is tune's own object,

#'
#' @section What its numbers are, and are not:
#'
#' The returned object answers `collect_metrics()`, and will hand its metrics
#' over without qualifying them. Every one of them is a **selection-time**
#' quantity: it was computed on the resamples that chose the candidate it
#' describes, which makes it optimistically biased as a claim about the model
#' this final fit produced. Nothing in that object is this model's performance.
#'
#' Report the nested estimate instead: `collect_metrics()` on the results
#' object the fit was built from, the [nested_tune_grid()] or
#' [nested_tune_bayes()] result. That number is measured on data no part of the
#' tune-and-fit procedure ever saw, which is what makes it an honest description
#' of the procedure that produced your model.
#'
#' The run is kept because it is the record of what selection saw, not because
#' it describes the model.

#' outer fold's `.inner_metrics` table describes on a [nested_tune_grid()] or

#' [tune::collect_metrics()] table, so a Bayesian final fit's table carries the
#' `.iter` column that path's tables do.
#'
#' @param x A `nested_final_fit` object from [nested_final_fit()].
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored.
#'
#' @return A tibble with one row per candidate scored, carrying one column per
#'   tuned parameter plus tune's `.config` label for the candidate, and `.iter`
#'   on a Bayesian fit. It is the distinct parameter rows of the run's
#'   [tune::collect_metrics()] table with those labels: the same shape one
#'   element of a result's `.inner_metrics` column reduces to when its metric
#'   columns are dropped, so the two can be compared directly. Everything
#'   tune wrote per metric is dropped: `.metric`, `.estimator`, `mean`, `n`,
#'   `std_err`, and on a fit that scored a dynamic survival metric the
#'   `.eval_time` column, so a candidate has one row here however many
#'   evaluation times it was scored at. The times and the scores are in
#'   `collect_metrics(extract_tune_results(x))`.
#'
#'   This is what was **scored**, not what was **asked for**. A `grid` given as
#'   a size is expanded by tune and may reach fewer candidates than the number
#'   requested; a candidate that failed everywhere scored nothing. See the
#'   `.inner_metrics` discussion in [nested_tune_grid()] for the full account
#'   of how the two records diverge, which holds here too: this record is
#'   derived the same way.
#'
#'   One pointer there does **not** carry over. A candidate that failed on every
#'   inner resample is missing from this table, and on a `nested_tune_grid()`
#'   result its failure is recorded in that object's `.notes` column. A
#'   `nested_final_fit` has no such column. Look instead inside the tuning run
#'   itself: `tune::collect_notes(extract_tune_results(x))`.
