# The final-fit path.
#
# What the nested estimate describes is a procedure: given a dataset, resample
# it by the inner specification, tune, select, fit. The deployment target of
# that procedure is the whole dataset, so the final model is produced by running
# the procedure again with every row in hand -- the refit step, one level up
# from the ordinary "cross-validate, then refit on everything" convention
# (RR02 Q1).
#
# It is a separate function returning a separate object because the estimate
# characterizes the procedure and never the model (IP3). Nothing here computes
# a performance number, and the object deliberately answers no generic that
# would produce one.

#' Fit the final model after nested cross-validation
#'
#' `nested_final_fit()` runs the tuning procedure a nested run recorded once
#' more, with the whole dataset in hand: it re-evaluates the design's inner
#' resampling specification against every row, tunes with [tune::tune_grid()],
#' [tune::tune_bayes()], one of finetune's racers or
#' [finetune::tune_sim_anneal()] under the arguments the results object
#' carries,
#' selects a candidate by the [selection_rule()] it recorded, finalizes the
#' workflow, and fits it on all the data. The result is the model to deploy,
#' built by the same search the estimate you report describes. On a
#' [nested_fit_resamples()] result there is no search to re-run: the workflow
#' is fitted as given on all the data.
#'
#' @param object A [workflows::workflow()] with at least one parameter marked
#'   for tuning with [tune::tune()]: the workflow the nested run was built
#'   around. For a grid or a racing procedure it is checked against the
#'   recorded grid the way [nested_tune_grid()] checked it, so a different
#'   workflow is refused here rather than by tune one tuning run later. For a
#'   [nested_fit_resamples()] result the workflow has no marker, and one
#'   carrying a marker is refused here with class `nestedtune_tuned_workflow`,
#'   as that orchestrator refused it.
#' @param results The `nested_results` object from [nested_tune_grid()],
#'   [nested_tune_bayes()], [nested_tune_race_anova()],
#'   [nested_tune_race_win_loss()], [nested_tune_sim_anneal()] or
#'   [nested_fit_resamples()] whose estimate you will report for this model.
#'   Everything the re-run needs is read from it: the design's inner
#'   resampling specification, recorded on the result as the design stored it;
#'   the data, which every split references; and the procedure -- the tuner
#'   and its own arguments (`grid`; `iter`, `initial` and `objective`; or
#'   `iter` and `initial`) with `param_info`, `event_level`, `eval_time`
#'   and `select`, the [selection_rule()] the folds selected by, and the
#'   metric set. A
#'   `param_info` parameter whose range is unknown until the data is seen is
#'   finalized here on the full data -- every row is this model's training
#'   data -- where each outer fold of the nested run finalized it on that
#'   fold's analysis rows alone, so the final model's candidate range can
#'   exceed any fold's. A results
#'   object that carries no such record (one built by an earlier version of
#'   nestedtune, or from a design assembled by hand rather than by
#'   [nested_resamples()] or [rsample::nested_cv()]), one that is no longer a
#'   `nested_results` (an operation that added or removed rows returns a plain
#'   tibble), and one with no rows are each refused before any fitting, with
#'   condition class `nestedtune_bad_results`. A results object in which no
#'   outer fold completed is refused next, with condition class
#'   `nestedtune_no_completed_folds`: there is no estimate to report a model
#'   with, and `summary()` on the object lists the stage each fold failed at.
#'   That is the class [collect_metrics()],
#'   [autoplot()][autoplot.nested_results] and [agreement()] refuse the same
#'   object with. A run in which some folds failed is fitted; its estimate is
#'   [collect_metrics()]'s, with that function's partial-run warning.
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored -- in particular the former `grid`,
#'   `param_info`, `metrics`, `event_level` and `eval_time` arguments, which
#'   now come from `results`.
#'
#' @return An object of class `nested_final_fit` with elements `workflow` (the
#'   trained workflow; the object answers [predict()][predict.nested_final_fit]
#'   and `augment()` directly, and [extract_workflow()] returns the workflow
#'   itself), `selected`
#'   (the parameters chosen), `tuning` (the tuning run they were chosen from),
#'   `tuning_seed` and `fit_seed` (the two seeds that reproduce it), and
#'   `procedure` (the record re-run, as `results` carried it). From a
#'   [nested_fit_resamples()] result, `selected` is an empty table, `tuning`
#'   is `NULL`, and [extract_tune_results()] and [extract_scored_candidates()]
#'   refuse the object with class `nestedtune_no_tuning_run`; its print says
#'   no tuning ran.
#'
#' @details
#' The procedure a nested estimate describes is "resample this dataset by the
#' inner specification, tune, select, fit", and the dataset that procedure is
#' meant to be applied to is all of yours. So the final model comes from running
#' it again with nothing held out: the same convention as cross-validating a
#' model and then refitting on everything, one level up.
#'
#' The outer folds play no part. Their selections are not pooled or voted on:
#' they belong to the estimate, which describes the procedure across the
#' instability those selections reveal, and not to this model.
#'
#' @section What to report:
#'
#' Report the estimate from [collect_metrics()] on the results object you
#' handed over -- the result of [nested_tune_grid()] or one of its siblings --
#' as this model's performance. The model and the estimate come from one
#' search by construction: the procedure is read from that object and cannot
#' be restated here. That number estimates the k-fold test
#' error of the whole tune-and-fit procedure that produced this model, measured
#' on data no part of the procedure ever touched. Expect it to run slightly
#' pessimistic: each outer fold trains on its analysis rows alone, so every
#' model it scores is built on less data than this one. Varma and Simon (2006)
#' measured a 4.2-point overshoot from that effect at n = 40, and Wilimitis and
#' Walsh (2023) about 1-2% of AUROC on 41,121 records. The offset shrinks with
#' fold size and is not a correction to apply.
#'
#' The model in hand has no honest number of its own. Everything computable from
#' its training data was consumed by selection or by fitting, **including the
#' resampling metrics inside the tuning run stored on this object**: those are
#' selection-time quantities, optimistically biased as a performance claim, and
#' `collect_metrics()` on `x$tuning` will hand them over without saying so. They
#' are kept because they are the record of what selection saw, not because they
#' describe this model.
#'
#' Two things the nested estimate does not say. It is marginal over selection,
#' not conditional on the parameters this model happens to carry, so it is not a
#' claim about this configuration specifically. And it describes new data drawn
#' like your training data, not a different population, and not a model
#' retrained at a different size.
#'
#' If the outer folds disagreed about the best parameters, report that too.
#'
#' @section Reproducibility:
#'
#' Seed the session before the call, as elsewhere in tidymodels; there is no
#' `seed` argument. On entry the function draws two seeds in a single
#' `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2)` call. The first covers building the
#' inner resamples *and* tuning; the second covers the final fit. Both are
#' applied with the generator kind pinned, and both are returned on the object.
#'
#' The run is reproducible by hand from those two seeds and the record
#' `extract_procedure(fit)` returns, every value below being one that record
#' holds (or, for
#' `metrics`, `attr(results, "metrics")`); the tuning call is the one the
#' record names, and `control` is the record's own -- the control the run
#' was given, or tune's default, with the slots the orchestrator forces
#' already applied:
#'
#' ```
#' set.seed(fit$tuning_seed, kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
#'          normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
#' inner <- <the design's `inside` specification>(data)
#' control <- extract_procedure(fit)$control
#' # a grid procedure: the recorded control, untouched
#' tuned <- tune_grid(object, inner, grid = grid, param_info = param_info,
#'   metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time, control = control)
#' # a racing procedure, ANOVA or win/loss: the race's own draws -- the
#' # resample order under `randomize` -- come from the stream the tuning
#' # seed set, so the recorded `control_race()` is likewise untouched
#' tuned <- tune_race_anova(object, inner, grid = grid, param_info = param_info,
#'   metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time, control = control)
#' tuned <- tune_race_win_loss(object, inner, grid = grid, param_info = param_info,
#'   metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time, control = control)
#' # an annealing procedure: the perturbations draw from the same stream, and
#' # `control_sim_anneal()` has no seed slot, so the recorded control is
#' # again untouched
#' tuned <- tune_sim_anneal(object, inner, iter = iter, initial = initial,
#'   param_info = param_info, metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time,
#'   control = control)
#' # a Bayesian procedure, the one branch that alters the control: the
#' # Gaussian process is seeded from the tuning seed, the rule
#' # nested_tune_bayes() fixes for every fold, so the recorded control --
#' # which carries no seed -- takes it here, and only here
#' control$seed <- fit$tuning_seed
#' tuned <- tune_bayes(object, inner, iter = iter, initial = initial,
#'   objective = objective, param_info = param_info, metrics = metrics,
#'   eval_time = eval_time, control = control)
#' final <- finalize_workflow(object, select_best(tuned, metric = <first metric>))
#'   # under the recorded default select; select_by_one_std_err() or
#'   # select_by_pct_loss() with the recorded orderings and limit otherwise
#' set.seed(fit$fit_seed, kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
#'          normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
#' fit(final, data)
#' ```
#'
#' A result from [nested_fit_resamples()] re-runs no tuning call. Both seeds
#' are still drawn, so the object's seed layout is the one above; the first
#' is consumed by nothing, the inner specification is not re-evaluated, and
#' the whole recipe is `fit(object, data)` under the second seed.
#'
#' Building the resamples sits *inside* the first seed's scope, not before it:
#' constructing an `rset` draws from the generator, so a version that built them
#' earlier would still be reproducible from the session seed but no longer from
#' the two seeds above.
#'
#' The caller's RNG state and generator kind are restored on exit, including
#' when the call errors. One consequence worth knowing: two consecutive calls
#' with no `set.seed()` between them return identical results, exactly as
#' repeated [tune::tune_grid()] calls do.
#'
#' This binds randomness that flows through R's generator. Engines that
#' randomize outside it (kernlab's SVMs, the deep-learning engines) cannot be
#' pinned by any R-side scheme, here or in tune.
#'
#' @section The inner specification is re-evaluated:
#'
#' A nested design stores its `inside` argument as an unevaluated call, the
#' nested run records it on its result, and this function evaluates it again,
#' against the whole dataset, in the environment you call from, not the one
#' the design was built in.
#'
#' Write it with literal arguments. `inside = vfold_cv(v = 5)` is re-evaluated
#' identically anywhere. `inside = vfold_cv(v = k)` is not: if `k` is gone by
#' the time you call this, you get an error naming the specification, and if
#' some *other* `k` is in scope you silently get a different design. Building a
#' design inside a function that parameterizes its resampling is the common way
#' to meet this.
