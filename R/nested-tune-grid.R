#' Run the nested cross-validation loop
#'
#' `nested_tune_grid()` drives the outer loop of nested cross-validation. For
#' each outer fold it tunes on that fold's inner resamples with
#' [tune::tune_grid()], selects the best candidate, finalizes the workflow, and
#' fits and scores it on the outer split with [tune::last_fit()]. Every step is
#' delegated to tune; what this function contributes is the loop, the
#' reproducibility contract, and a results object that keeps each fold's chosen
#' parameters rather than discarding them.
#'
#' The estimate this returns describes the whole tune-and-fit *procedure*, not
#' any single fitted model. It is not the performance of a model you can deploy,
#' and no final model is returned here: build that with [nested_final_fit()],
#' which takes this result and runs the procedure it recorded again with the
#' whole dataset in hand. The estimate from this function is what you report
#' for it.
#'
#' For a Bayesian inner loop -- [tune::tune_bayes()] proposing candidates one
#' at a time -- see [nested_tune_bayes()]; for a raced grid -- finetune
#' eliminating candidates as the inner resamples come in -- see
#' [nested_tune_race_anova()] and [nested_tune_race_win_loss()]; and for
#' simulated annealing -- finetune perturbing the current candidate one
#' iteration at a time -- see [nested_tune_sim_anneal()]. Each runs this same
#' outer loop with the inner tuner swapped.
#'
#' @param object A [workflows::workflow()] with at least one parameter marked
#'   for tuning with [tune::tune()].
#' @param ... A control object as `control` -- what [tune::control_grid()]
#'   returns for `nested_tune_grid()`, what [tune::control_bayes()] returns for
#'   `nested_tune_bayes()` -- and nothing else. It reaches the inner tuning
#'   call in every fold, and in the final fit, with the slots this package
#'   forces overwritten; the section on differences from tune says what
#'   becomes of each slot. Any other name is an error, as is an unnamed
#'   value: everything after `...` is matched by name, so a mistyped or
#'   unsupported argument is an error rather than a silent positional match.
#' @param resamples A nested resampling design, from [nested_resamples()] or
#'   [rsample::nested_cv()]: a data frame whose `splits` column holds one
#'   `rsplit` per outer fold, whose `inner_resamples` column holds one `rset`
#'   with at least one row per outer fold, and whose every other column
#'   labels the outer folds. A label column must be named `id`, or `id`
#'   followed by a digit from 1 to 9 (the names rsample and tune read id
#'   columns by), and hold character or factor values; taken together, the
#'   label columns must give every outer fold a distinct label with no `NA`.
#'   Inside each inner `rset`, every element of its `splits` column is an
#'   `rsplit`; all of a fold's inner splits carry one frame, either the outer
#'   split's own data frame (what [nested_resamples()] builds) or that split's
#'   analysis set (what [rsample::nested_cv()] builds); and an inner split
#'   carrying the outer data frame indexes, in its `in_id` and any non-`NA`
#'   `out_id`, only rows the outer split's `in_id` holds, so that no inner
#'   analysis or assessment set reaches a row the outer fold holds out. A
#'   design breaking any of this, or using a bootstrap for the outer loop, is
#'   refused at the call, before anything is fitted, with condition class
#'   `nestedtune_bad_design` and every offending row, column, inner split or
#'   index named. The checks exist because [rsample::nested_cv()] builds a
#'   design whatever its `inside` argument returned (a specification that
#'   produces no `rset`, or an empty one, gives a design that cannot be run,
#'   where [nested_resamples()] refuses one at construction), and because a
#'   design assembled by hand can index rows its outer fold never sees.
#' @param param_info A [dials::parameters()] object, or `NULL` to let tune
#'   derive one from the workflow. Passed unchanged to [tune::tune_grid()] on
#'   every outer fold, so a restricted range restricts the grid every fold
#'   searches. A parameter whose range is unknown until the data is seen
#'   (`mtry()`, or a `min_n()` finalized by row count) is finalized by tune
#'   on the outer fold's analysis rows -- never on the rows that fold holds
#'   out -- so on a [nested_resamples()] design the inner call receives the
#'   fold's inner resamples re-pointed at its analysis set rather than the
#'   design's own `inner_resamples` element, which indexes the whole data.
#'   A design from [rsample::nested_cv()] already carries the analysis set
#'   and is passed as it is, as is the design's element under an outer split
#'   that repeats a row (an evaluated [rsample::manual_rset()]), where the
#'   re-pointing is ambiguous. [nested_final_fit()] finalizes on the full data.
#' @param grid A data frame of candidate parameter values, or a positive whole
#'   number giving the size of a grid to generate. Passed to
#'   [tune::tune_grid()]. A data frame is checked against the workflow before
#'   anything is fitted: every column must name a parameter marked with
#'   [tune::tune()], and every such parameter must have a column.
#' @param metrics A [yardstick::metric_set()], or `NULL` to use tune's defaults
#'   for the model's mode. The first metric in the set selects the best inner
#'   candidate.
#' @param event_level `"first"` (the default) or `"second"`, naming which level
#'   of a two-class outcome factor is the event. It reaches both loops: the
#'   inner tuning run, where it decides which candidate is selected, and the
#'   outer scoring fit, where it decides what the reported metrics mean.
#'   Metrics that do not distinguish the two levels -- accuracy, `roc_auc`,
#'   `brier_class` -- are unaffected by it; `sens`, `spec`, `precision` and
#'   their relatives are not. Ignored for a regression model, as it is in tune.
#'
#' @param eval_time A numeric vector of evaluation times for a censored
#'   regression model, or `NULL` (the default) to leave the choice to tune. It
#'   reaches every tune call whose answer depends on it, so a dynamic or
#'   integrated survival metric -- `brier_survival()`, `roc_auc_survival()` and
#'   their relatives -- is measured at the times you name. It is ignored, with
#'   a warning from tune, whenever the metric set has no metric that reads it.
#'   tune keys that warning on the metrics rather than on the model's mode: a
#'   set with no survival metric draws one saying the argument is only used
#'   for censored regression, and a censored regression model scored only by a
#'   static metric such as `concordance_survival()` draws a different one,
#'   saying it is only used for dynamic or integrated survival metrics.
#'
#'   Refused here, ahead of tune: anything that is not numeric, an empty
#'   vector, and any element that is missing, negative or not finite. tune
#'   treats those unevenly, and only once a metric reads the times -- a
#'   character value that reads as a number, such as `"1"`, is coerced with
#'   `as.numeric()` and accepted, one that does not becomes missing; a
#'   missing, negative or infinite element is dropped with a warning; and an
#'   empty vector, or one that dropping has emptied, aborts -- and this package
#'   refuses them all at entry, before a whole run is paid for. Zero, repeated
#'   times and times out of order are accepted and passed on untouched, since
#'   tune normalizes those itself; a repeated time draws tune's warning that 0
#'   inappropriate evaluation time points were removed, once per tune call.
#'
#' @return An object of class `nested_results`: one row per outer fold, with the
#'   fold's split and id, the metrics scored on its assessment set
#'   (`.metrics`), the parameters chosen for it by inner tuning (`.selected`),
#'   the inner tuning run's own metrics (`.inner_metrics`), whether the fold
#'   finished (`.completed`), anything that went wrong (`.notes`), and the two
#'   seeds that reproduce it (`.tuning_seed`, `.outer_fit_seed`). Use
#'   [collect_metrics()] to summarize.
#'
#'   **Two records describe the grid, and they answer different questions.**
#'   `attr(x, "grid")` holds the `grid` argument **as it was given**: a
#'   positive whole number, not a table of candidates, whenever a size was
#'   passed. The `.inner_metrics` column holds what each outer fold's inner
#'   tuning actually scored: [tune::collect_metrics()] of that fold's tuning
#'   run, one table per fold with a column per tuned parameter, one row per
#'   candidate and metric, and tune's `.metric`, `.estimator`, `mean`, `n`,
#'   `std_err` and `.config` columns, with `.eval_time` beside them when a
#'   dynamic survival metric was scored. The candidates a fold searched are the
#'   table's distinct parameter rows. Ranking those rows on one metric by
#'   `mean` reproduces the fold's `.selected` except where candidates tie,
#'   which [tune::select_best()] resolved on the inner run in its own order;
#'   `.selected` records the candidate the fold's outer fit used.
#'
#'   The two diverge routinely, in both directions. A size is expanded by tune
#'   and may reach fewer candidates than were asked for (a request for 20 on a
#'   parameter with four reachable values evaluates four), and a candidate
#'   that fails scores nothing. Folds can also differ from *each other*:
#'   expanding a size draws from the generator, and each fold tunes under its
#'   own seed, so a continuous parameter gives every fold its own candidates.
#'   Printing says so when it happens.
#'
#'   One limit is worth stating plainly. `.inner_metrics` is tune's summary of
#'   the tuning run, and a candidate that failed on **every** inner resample
#'   scored nothing: it has no row there. `.notes` is where its failure is
#'   recorded. A candidate that failed on some inner resamples and scored on
#'   others has its rows, with `n` below the inner resample count. A fold that
#'   scored no candidate at all carries a zero-row table with a completed
#'   fold's columns, never `NULL`.
#'
#'   `attr(x, "metrics")` holds the `metrics` argument, and is absent rather
#'   than `NULL` when none was supplied. `.inner_metrics` is a column, so it
#'   travels with the fold it describes.
#'
#'   The `procedure` record, which [extract_procedure()] returns, records what
#'   ran, on the result of every
#'   orchestrator: a named list giving the tuner (`"tune_grid"` here,
#'   `"tune_bayes"` from [nested_tune_bayes()], `"tune_race_anova"` or
#'   `"tune_race_win_loss"` from [nested_tune_race_anova()] and its sibling,
#'   `"tune_sim_anneal"` from [nested_tune_sim_anneal()]),
#'   that tuner's own arguments (`grid` here and for the racers; `iter`,
#'   `initial` and `objective` for the Bayesian tuner, `iter` and `initial`
#'   for annealing), and `param_info`,
#'   `event_level` and `eval_time` on all. A Bayesian result carries the
#'   `procedure` record and no `grid` attribute, and its `.inner_metrics`
#'   tables carry an `.iter` column; [nested_tune_bayes()] documents both.
#'
#'   **What an operation on the object may and may not do.** The result carries
#'   the invariants `tune` declares on its own results objects:
#'
#'   * rows may be reordered, but never added or removed;
#'   * columns may be added or reordered;
#'   * every column listed above must still be present, holding the values it
#'     held.
#'
#'   The columns the run is recorded in are the ones the resampling design
#'   named, and `nested_tune_grid()` records them when it builds the result. So
#'   a column you add afterwards is read as a fold label only when the design
#'   itself carries a column of that name: `id`, and `id2` for a repeated
#'   design. The name you pick decides nothing on its own: adding `id2` to a
#'   result from a plain v-fold design leaves the class, the record and the
#'   fold labels alone, exactly as adding `extra` does.
#'
#'   An operation that stays inside those rules (`arrange()`, `mutate()`
#'   adding a column, a join that matches one row apiece) returns a
#'   `nested_results` with the call's record intact. Anything else (`slice()`,
#'   a `filter()` that drops a fold, `bind_rows()`, `x[1, ]`, dropping one of
#'   the columns above) returns a bare tibble, with the record removed along
#'   with the class. A three-row object cannot honestly describe itself as the
#'   ten-fold design it was cut from, so it stops describing itself at all and
#'   hands back the data.
#'
#'   It is one rule, reached through four doors. dplyr's verbs and `[` reach it
#'   through a `dplyr_reconstruct()` method; **vctrs**' own verbs
#'   (`vec_slice()`, `vec_rbind()`, `vec_c()`, `vec_cbind()`, `vec_ptype()` and
#'   `vec_cast()`) reach it through `vec_restore()`; and `rbind()` and
#'   `rename()`, which reach neither generic, have methods of their own. So
#'   `rbind(x, x)` and a `rename()` that moves one of the columns above hand
#'   back a bare tibble, the same answer `slice()` gives, rather than an object
#'   whose record has stopped describing its own rows.
#'
#'   Combining is the one place the doors part. `vctrs::vec_rbind(x)` and
#'   `vctrs::vec_c(x)` hand back a bare tibble even with nothing to combine `x`
#'   with, where `dplyr::bind_rows(x)` returns a `nested_results`: vctrs asks
#'   for the common type before it asks the rule anything, and the common type
#'   of one results object is a plain table. Every combination of two or more
#'   returns a bare tibble through either door, which is the rule above.
#'
#'   Column-binding is the one place argument order shows. `bind_cols()` and
#'   `vec_cbind()` both build their answer on the first argument's type, so
#'   `bind_cols(x, extra)` and `vec_cbind(x, extra)` are a `nested_results`
#'   while `bind_cols(extra, x)` and `vec_cbind(extra, x)` are plain tibbles
#'   holding the same ten columns. Either verb answers the same way in either
#'   position.
#'
#'   Three verbs sit outside all of it. `group_by()`, `rowwise()` and
#'   `tibble::as_tibble()` return a grouped, a rowwise and a plain tibble
#'   respectively (none of them a `nested_results`), and each carries the
#'   attributes across, so `attr(dplyr::group_by(x, id), "outer_label")` still
#'   answers with the run's scheme. Nothing they hand back claims to be a
#'   results object; the record is along for the ride.
#'
#' @section Reproducibility:
#'
#' Seed the session before the call, as elsewhere in tidymodels; there is no
#' `seed` argument. On entry the function draws `2 * n` seeds in a single
#' `sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, 2 * n)` call, where `n` is the number of
#' outer folds. Fold `i` uses element `2 * i - 1` for its tuning step and
#' element `2 * i` for its outer fit, each applied with the generator kind
#' pinned. Because a fold's seed depends on its position and not on the order
#' folds are executed in, the result is the same however the loop is scheduled.
#'
#' This makes any single fold reproducible by hand. Fold `i` is exactly
#' (on a [nested_resamples()] design, `resamples$inner_resamples[[i]]` here
#' stands for that inner rset re-pointed at `analysis(resamples$splits[[i]])`
#' -- the frame each inner split carries is the fold's analysis set, its
#' indices remapped -- which changes the call only when `param_info` carries
#' an unknown range, finalized on those rows as `param_info` describes):
#'
#' ```
#' set.seed(res$.tuning_seed[[i]], kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
#'          normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
#' tuned <- tune_grid(object, resamples$inner_resamples[[i]], grid = grid,
#'                    metrics = metrics, eval_time = eval_time,
#'                    control = extract_procedure(res)$control)
#' final <- finalize_workflow(object, select_best(tuned, metric = <first metric>))
#' set.seed(res$.outer_fit_seed[[i]], kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
#'          normal.kind = "Inversion", sample.kind = "Rejection")
#' last_fit(final, resamples$splits[[i]], metrics = metrics,
#'          eval_time = eval_time,
#'          control = control_last_fit(event_level = event_level))
#' ```
#'
#' The caller's RNG state and generator kind are restored on exit, including
#' when the call errors, so a seeded script that draws afterwards is
#' unaffected: the same contract [tune::tune_grid()] gives. One consequence
#' worth knowing: two consecutive calls with no `set.seed()` between them
#' return identical results, exactly as repeated `tune_grid()` calls do.
#'
#' This binds randomness that flows through R's generator. Engines that
#' randomize outside it (kernlab's SVMs, the deep-learning engines) cannot be
#' pinned by any R-side scheme, here or in tune.
#'
#' @section When a fold fails:
#'
#' A fold that fails does not end the run. The remaining folds still run, and
#' the fold that failed is recorded rather than discarded: `.completed` is
#' `FALSE` for it and `.notes` holds what went wrong, in the same shape tune
#' uses: one row naming the stage that failed (`"inner tuning"` or
#' `"outer fit"`), followed by tune's own notes about the underlying cause.
#' The number of folds attempted and the number completed are stored on the
#' object as the `folds_attempted` and `folds_completed` attributes.
#'
#' Both stages can fail quietly. Inner tuning raises only once every candidate
#' has failed, and the outer fit does not raise at all: it hands back a result
#' with no metrics. Both are recorded as failures here.
#'
#' A fold can also complete *and* carry notes. When only some of a fold's inner
#' resamples fail, tuning still returns a candidate and the fold finishes, but
#' its parameters were chosen on less of the inner design than was asked for.
#' Those notes are kept, so `.completed` being `TRUE` with a non-empty `.notes`
#' means exactly that: it worked, on less than the whole design.
#'
#' A failed fold still records the candidates it got as far as scoring, whatever
#' stage it failed at. A fold that died at the outer fit had already tuned, so
#' its `.inner_metrics` holds the full table, and so does one that tuned
#' successfully and then failed while selecting from the results. Only a fold
#' that never reached a scored candidate at all (tuning itself raised, or
#' every candidate failed) holds a zero-row table. No fold is reported as
#' having searched a grid it did not.
#'
#' Any operation outside the invariants stated under **Value** above returns a
#' bare tibble, and both counts go with the class rather than being recomputed
#' for whatever rows are left. Dropping the `.completed` column is one such
#' operation.
#'
#' The run warns when it finishes with any fold unfinished, and
#' [collect_metrics()] warns again, summarizing only the folds that ran and
#' reporting how many those were. It refuses outright when no fold completed:
#' an estimate is never reported for a design that did not execute.
#'
#' @section Parallel execution:
#'
#' The outer folds run in parallel when you have started mirai daemons, and
#' serially otherwise. There is no argument for this: start daemons before the
#' call and the loop uses them:
#'
#' ```
#' mirai::daemons(4)
#' res <- nested_tune_grid(wf, folds, grid = grid)
#' mirai::daemons(0)
#' ```
#'
#' Two or more daemons are needed before the loop dispatches; below that it
#' stays serial, the same threshold `tune` applies. Inner tuning always runs
#' serially whatever you set, because nested parallelism oversubscribes cores.
#'
#' **Results do not depend on how the loop ran.** The same seed gives the same
#' result serially and in parallel, at any number of daemons: each fold's seeds
#' are drawn up front and assigned by position, so a fold's outcome depends on
#' where it sits in the design and never on which worker took it or in what
#' order. One exception, and it carries no numbers: the backtraces stored in
#' `.notes` record where a fold executed, so a fold that failed on a daemon
#' carries that daemon's call stack rather than yours. The note text, its
#' location, and its type are the same either way, though a daemon wraps long
#' message lines to its own console width rather than your terminal's.
#'
#' **Each fold is sent one copy of the data, not one per inner split.** A
#' resampling split carries the whole frame it indexes, and sending a fold to a
#' daemon means serializing it, which does not preserve the single shared copy
#' the design holds in memory. Each fold's splits are therefore emptied before
#' dispatch and refilled on the worker, so what crosses is the fold's row
#' indices plus one copy of the data rather than one copy per split. On a design
#' built by [nested_resamples()] that is one copy per fold; a design from
#' [rsample::nested_cv()] materializes an analysis frame per outer fold, so each
#' fold also carries its own, still once rather than once per inner split.
#'
#' Two things this does not reach, both of them objects you supply rather than
#' anything the package builds. A recipe keeps a copy of the data it was created
#' with, and a formula carries the environment it was written in, so a workflow
#' built inside a function that holds a large object sends that object with
#' every fold. Building the workflow at the top level avoids the second.
#'
#' Daemons are **separate R processes**, which has consequences worth knowing:
#'
#' - They do not inherit your session's options, your `.libPaths()` changes, or
#'   environment variables you set after launching them. Set what a fold needs
#'   with [mirai::everywhere()], or start the daemons after setting it.
#' - They load nestedtune from an installed library. Running under
#'   `devtools::load_all()` is not enough: the daemons cannot see it, and the
#'   call stops rather than failing every fold with the same opaque note. During
#'   development, prime them with
#'   `mirai::everywhere(pkgload::load_all("<path>"))`.
#' - Before dispatching, the call asks **every** connected daemon whether it can
#'   load the package, and stops if any of them cannot. A pool whose daemons
#'   differ (one respawned, or started against a different library) therefore
#'   fails here, naming how many are affected, rather than as a run in which
#'   some folds come back as opaque worker failures.
#' - The same round trip asks each daemon which of this session's internal
#'   functions its own copy of the package defines, and stops if any are
#'   missing. A daemon holding an *older install* loads the package perfectly
#'   well and then fails every fold, because the worker resolves what it needs
#'   by name inside that daemon's copy. The error names the missing functions
#'   and asks you to reinstall and then restart the pool: a running daemon
#'   keeps the namespace it has already loaded, so reinstalling underneath one
#'   changes nothing until it is replaced.
#' - The same round trip also asks every daemon for each package the workflow
#'   and the tuner need (the engine's, a recipe step's, and for a race the
#'   package its model is fitted with), and stops when one daemon cannot load
#'   one of them, naming how many daemons are affected and which packages.
#'   Install them into the daemons' library and restart the pool.
#' - A daemon that does not answer at all is reported as a non-response, not as
#'   a missing package, so a merely slow daemon is never met with advice to
#'   install what you already have. The check waits 30 seconds by default; set
#'   `options(nestedtune.preflight_timeout = <milliseconds>)` to raise or lower
#'   that, to a single positive, finite number. Nothing statistical depends on
#'   it.
#' - The first parallel call after starting daemons is the slow one: the check
#'   is what makes every daemon load the package, and the whole tidymodels
#'   stack is not cheap to load. Because the check now waits for *all* of them
#'   rather than whichever answers first, a cold pool on a loaded machine can
#'   need more than the default 30 seconds; raise the option if you see a
#'   non-response you do not believe. Later calls in the same session reuse
#'   what the daemons already loaded.
#' - That check is bounded; the folds themselves are not. If every daemon dies
#'   *after* folds are dispatched, the call blocks waiting for results that will
#'   never arrive, and you interrupt it. No per-fold timeout is imposed, because
#'   no time limit is defensible for an arbitrary model fit: a slow fold and a
#'   dead one would be indistinguishable.
#'
#' A fold whose worker dies is recorded as a failed fold, exactly like any other
#' failure: the run finishes, the other folds keep their results, and `.notes`
#' names the worker as the stage.
#'
#' Stopping a run is not a fold failure. A fold that was never given a chance to
#' run has not been attempted, so recording it as one would describe a design
#' that did not execute. Stopping the dispatched tasks therefore aborts the call
#' and returns nothing, raising a `nestedtune_cancelled` condition. That class
#' inherits from `nestedtune_interrupted`, which is what a task interrupted on
#' its own daemon raises, so a handler for the general case catches both and one
#' that cares can tell them apart. Either way the caller's RNG state is restored
#' on the way out.
#'
#' Interrupting the call at your own console is not one of these. It unwinds the
#' blocking wait before any worker's return value is classified, so an ordinary
#' interrupt propagates and no nestedtune condition class is attached: the RNG
#' state is still restored, but do not write a handler expecting one.
#'
#' An interrupt also asks the folds it leaves behind to stop. However the call
#' is left once its folds are dispatched (an interrupt, or an error), the
#' outstanding ones are cancelled on the way out, so the pool goes idle shortly
#' after rather than computing folds whose results nobody will read. Two limits
#' are worth knowing. Cancelling needs mirai's dispatcher, which
#' `mirai::daemons(n)` starts by default; on a pool started with
#' `dispatcher = FALSE` the request cannot reach the workers at all and the
#' folds run to completion. You are told so at dispatch rather than left to
#' discover it: such a pool raises a warning of class
#' `nestedtune_pool_not_cancellable`, once per call, naming the remedy. The pool
#' is not refused, because its results are correct: what it lacks is the
#' ability to stop. And stopping is a request rather than a guarantee:
#' a fold already inside a compiled fitting routine may not be interruptible,
#' and one that has nearly finished may simply finish.
#'
#' One case cannot be told apart, and is documented rather than guessed at:
#' calling `mirai::daemons(0)` while folds are outstanding produces exactly the
#' value a daemon dying mid-fold produces: same code, same classes, nothing to
#' separate them. Tearing the pool down that way is therefore recorded as fold
#' failures rather than treated as a cancellation, because the alternative would
#' discard every completed fold whenever a single worker died.
#'
#' @section Differences from calling tune directly:
#'
#' There is no `control` formal, but a [tune::control_grid()] passed through
#' `...` as `control` reaches the inner `tune_grid()` in every fold, and in
#' the final fit that re-runs the result. What runs is the control passed, or
#' tune's default when none is, with the slots this package forces
#' overwritten; the result records that effective control as
#' `extract_procedure(res)$control`, which is what the recipe above passes.
#' Every slot of `control_grid()` falls under one of six headings.
#'
#' **Forced: `allow_par`.** Both tune calls a fold makes -- the inner tuning
#' run and the outer scoring fit -- run at `allow_par = FALSE`, whatever the
#' control carries. Parallelism belongs over the outer folds, as above, and
#' leaving that to a caller would put two pools in contention.
#'
#' **Settable as its own argument: `event_level`.** The argument reaches the
#' inner `control_grid()` and the outer `control_last_fit()` alike, and is the
#' one place the level is set: a control left at tune's default takes the
#' argument's level, and a control naming a level that is neither tune's
#' default nor the argument's is refused at entry, naming both. `eval_time`
#' is offered the same way, though it is not a control slot in tune either --
#' it is an argument of both `tune_grid()` and `last_fit()` -- and for the
#' same reason: it changes a number the caller is shown.
#'
#' **Refused: none.** No slot is refused on its own. What is refused at entry
#' is a control of another class -- a `control_bayes()`, which tune itself
#' would accept here -- and the `event_level` conflict above. The class is
#' the contract: tune gives [tune::control_resamples()] and
#' [tune::control_last_fit()] the `control_grid` class, so either is accepted
#' as what `control_grid()` returns, its slots read under these headings.
#'
#' **Passed through: `verbose`, `pkgs`, `parallel_over`, `workflow_size`.**
#' Each reaches `tune_grid()` as given. `verbose` prints from a serial run,
#' beside the progress the outer loop reports, and from a mirai daemon where
#' nothing shows it. `pkgs` is required before fitting on the serial path as
#' on the parallel one, where the daemon pre-flight has already required this
#' package's namespace in every worker. `parallel_over` is not inert at
#' `allow_par = FALSE`: it still chooses how tune loops over resamples and
#' candidates, and with it the seed each model fit starts from, so a
#' stochastic engine's numbers differ between `"resamples"` and
#' `"everything"`; left `NULL`, tune takes `"resamples"` when there is more
#' than one inner resample. `workflow_size` is the size past which tune
#' remarks on a workflow `save_workflow` keeps, so it speaks only beside that
#' slot, and only where the run it lands on is kept.
#'
#' **Not returned: `extract`, `save_pred`, `save_workflow`.** Each lands on
#' the inner `tune_results`. A fold record discards that run once the fold
#' succeeds -- the fold keeps its metrics, its selection and the candidates it
#' scored -- so on a nested run setting them costs the work and returns
#' nothing. The final fit is the exception: [nested_final_fit()] re-runs the
#' recorded control and keeps its tuning run as `$tuning`, where
#' [extract_tune_results()] reaches what these saved.
#'
#' **Inert: `backend_options`.** Options for a parallel backend, with no
#' backend to reach at `allow_par = FALSE`.
#'
#' Not passed on: `select_best()` is called without `eval_time`. Left unset it
#' selects at the first of the evaluation times the tuning run was built with,
#' which are the ones named here, so naming them twice would change no choice
#' and would repeat tune's message about which time it took.
