# Take the data out of one fold's payload, and put it back on the worker.
#
# Every rsplit carries the whole frame it indexes. In memory those are one
# shared copy -- that is what nested_resamples() exists to achieve -- but R's
# serializer does not preserve sharing for ordinary objects, so each split wrote
# its own copy onto the wire: six of them for v = 5, inner_v = 5, measured
# 5,141,166 B against 840,540 B of data. `lobstr::obj_size()` reports 946.94 kB
# for that same payload and so cannot see the defect at all, which is why the
# guards in test-parallel-payload.R measure the serialized stream.
#
# `$data` is blanked with `x["data"] <- list(NULL)` rather than `x$data <- NULL`
# on purpose: assigning NULL to a list element DELETES it, and the rehydrated
# object would then carry `data` in last position instead of its own. The round
# trip has to be `identical()` to what the serial branch passes, not merely
# equivalent, or IP2's serial-vs-parallel comparison is testing two shapes.
#
# What each frame is compared against is `shared`, the one copy `.args` carries.
# A nested_resamples() design indexes a single frame throughout, so nothing is
# carried per fold. An rsample::nested_cv() design materializes each outer
# fold's analysis set, so that fold's inner frame is neither the original nor
# any other fold's and travels with the fold -- still once, rather than once per
# inner split. `identical()` decides which case a fold is in: it takes a pointer
# fast path when the frames are the same object (0.04 ms against 1.05 ms on a
# 32 MB frame), and an equal-but-distinct frame answering TRUE is sound here,
# since substituting one for the other is exactly what rehydration does.
# Whether this is a fold payload that can be leaned without changing a result.
#
# Read with `[[` and `names()`, never `$`: `$` partial-matches on a plain list,
# so `x$split` would answer a payload carrying `splits` and `x$inner` one
# carrying `inner_resamples`. is_fold_record() uses `%in% names(x)` for the same
# reason, and this is the discipline it claims parity with.
#
# The last clause is defence in depth. lean_payload() takes ONE frame for the
# fold's inner splits and rehydrate_payload() writes it back onto all of them,
# which is only sound if they shared it to begin with. Since M59 check_nested()
# refuses, at the driver's call, a design whose inner splits do not all carry
# the outer split's frame or its analysis set (check_inner_splits(), D-049),
# so no real design reaches here failing the clause. The stand-in payloads the
# dispatch tests drive dispatch_folds() with carry neither `split` nor `inner`
# and fail the first clause above, never this one. Were a payload to fail it,
# it would be tuned on the wrong rows in parallel and the right ones serially
# (an IP2 breach, an IP1 exposure where the substituted frame holds outer
# assessment rows), and the fat path is slower and correct.

# Ask every connected daemon, not whichever one is free.

# The M07 defect: a single mirai() task is taken by ONE daemon, so a pool that
# is heterogeneous -- a respawned daemon, differing library paths -- had one
# loadable daemon answer for all of them, and every fold that landed elsewhere
# came back as an opaque worker failure. everywhere() is the mechanism that
# reaches all of them: verified to return one element per connected daemon
# (distinct pids), and to queue behind a daemon that is busy rather than skip it.
#
# It carries no `.timeout` of its own, so the bound is a poll on unresolved()
# to a deadline followed by stop_mirai(), which resolves every outstanding
# element to errorValue 20 and leaves the pool usable (both verified by
# execution, M10 T1).
#
# Answers are then read one element at a time from `$data`, which yields
# `unresolvedValue` for anything still outstanding, rather than through the
# map's own `[` -- that collects, and collecting BLOCKS until every element
# resolves. Reading per element cannot block at all, so the bound holds even if
# stop_mirai() leaves something behind.
#
# That covers the read. The send is the other half, and it is a claim about
# mirai rather than about this code: everywhere() must return without waiting
# for a daemon to be free, or the bound below would never start counting.
# Verified by execution against mirai 2.7.2 / nanonext 1.10.1 -- on a pool whose
# every daemon was already occupied it returned in 0.001 s with the probe
# unresolved and queued (M15 T5). It is deliberately NOT claimed of mirai in
# general: a version whose send blocked on a saturated pool would hang here, and
# no R-side bound could break it, setTimeLimit() not reaching a blocked mirai
# call (M14).
# What the host expects a daemon's copy of the package to contain.
#
# `ls()` rather than `names()`: it drops the dotted internals a namespace
# carries for its own bookkeeping, which differ between an installed package and
# one under pkgload and would report every daemon as incompatible.
#
# The whole namespace rather than the two symbols dispatch_folds() actually
# resolves by name (`rehydrate_payload` at :232, `nested_fold_fit` at :585).
# A hand-maintained list of those two is the defect this check exists to
# catch -- M23 added the second and nothing made the pre-flight notice -- so the
# manifest is derived, never written down. It costs 2,627 B serialized for 106
# names against a per-fold payload already in the megabytes.
# A package this session has no copy of yields no expectation at all, rather
# than an error. The manifest answers "what does MY build contain"; with no
# build here there is nothing to compare a daemon against, so the check falls
# back to the load question it asked before M24 -- which is precisely what the
# `package` argument exists to ask (M24 review F6: this raised an unclassified
# error instead, from asNamespace() running on the HOST). It cannot weaken the
# real check: the manifest for `nestedtune` is taken by a function living in
# `nestedtune`, so the empty branch is unreachable for the package's own probe.

# What each daemon is asked to evaluate, built from text rather than written as
# live source.
#
# `everywhere()` captures its expression unevaluated and serializes it, so the
# daemons run whatever the HOST's copy of this function body has been rewritten
# into -- not what is written here. Under `covr` that rewriting inserts a
# `covr:::count()` call inside every `{` block, this probe's braces included, and
# a daemon whose library has no covr raises on it. The raise returns as a
# miraiError, daemon_report() rightly refuses it, and a pool that answered
# perfectly well is classified as silent. That is why M24's first cut failed the
# coverage job while passing all five `R CMD check` legs (M24 review F15).
#
# A string is data, not source, so no rewriting reaches it and the daemons
# receive exactly the expression written below. Verified against
# `covr:::trace_calls()`: the counters land around the everywhere() call and
# never inside the expression it sends.
#
# The symbol check is nested inside the load branch because asNamespace() on a
# package that will not load raises, and a raised probe comes back as a
# miraiError -- a length-1 CHARACTER vector, which daemon_report() rejects,
# turning a clean "cannot load" into a silent daemon and losing the actionable
