# Printing a nested_results, and summarizing one.
#
# The two answer different questions and this file keeps them apart. print()
# describes the OBJECT: it is a tibble of outer folds, so it shows its rows,
# says how much of the design did not run, and points at summary() for the rest.
# summary() says what the run MEANS: the design, the failures and their stages,
# the selections, and the estimate across the folds that completed.
#
# Every fact either one reports is derived from the columns at call time rather
# than read off the counts stamped at construction. The stamped counts describe
# the run the rows came from; a subset's rows are their own run, and both
# methods must describe the object in hand (IP4).
#
# Printing never raises and never warns. summary() and collect_metrics() warn on
# a partial run, because asking what a design that only partly ran means
# deserves an answer with a condition attached; printing is a description of an
# object, and an object that describes a failed run is exactly what M03 built.

#' Shows the object: its outer folds as the tibble rows they are, the outer

#'
#' Printing also says when the folds were not choosing from the same menu. A
#' grid given as a size is expanded per fold, under that fold's own seed, so a
#' continuous parameter leaves every fold with its own candidates, which
#' changes how the selections [summary.nested_results()] reports should be

#'   option's count with a footer saying how many more there are. `Inf` shows

#' Answers what the run means: how much of the requested outer design ran,

#' selected, and the estimate across the folds that completed.

#' The selection lines are the part nothing else in the ecosystem shows. When
#' outer folds choose different parameters, the tuning procedure is unstable on
#' this data: averaging the metrics hides that, so the summary marks it.
#'
#' Summarizing a run that only partly completed warns, and still returns the
#' summary: the folds that ran are described, and the warning says the design
#' asked for more. A run where every fold failed is the same case: it warns
