# The tuner description: which tune function a fold calls, and the static
# arguments only that function takes.
#
# One loop runs both orchestrators (D-040). What differs between them is the
# inner call -- `tune_grid()` takes a `grid`, `tune_bayes()` takes `iter`,
# `initial` and `objective` -- and everything else a fold needs (`object`,
# `param_info`, `metrics`, `eval_time`, `event_level`) is common. So the
# orchestrator builds one of these and threads it through the dispatch chain
# in place of the `grid` formal, and the worker assembles the call from it.
# The description holds no function object, only the function's name: package
# functions serialize by namespace name, so a mirai daemon resolves it inside
# its own copy of tune, and a name costs nothing on the wire (M12/M23).
#
# The record a results object carries (`procedure`) is built from the same
# description, which is what lets a later final fit re-run what ran (M46).

# The tuner registry (M50): everything the package knows about a tuner that
# is not the fold's own arguments, keyed by the tune or finetune function's
# name -- the `tuner` field of a description and of a results object's
# `procedure` record. Every site that used to switch on that name reads one
# of these fields instead, so a new tuner is one entry here and its export.
#
# `package` is where the function lives, and what the inner call's `.ns` and
# a daemon's `library()` name. `requires` is what must be installed before
# the tuner can run at all: the package itself, and for finetune's racers the
# package each race calls `rlang::check_installed()` on inside the fold --
# lme4 for the ANOVA race, BradleyTerry2 for the win/loss race (finetune
# 1.3.0, read 2026-09-02) -- refused at entry instead (GP3). `control` builds
# tune's default for the tuner, and `control_class` is the class a caller's
# control must carry -- the contract, since `condense_control()` reads slots
# by name and would take a `control_bayes()` for a `control_grid()` without
# complaint. `takes_grid` says the tuner's own argument is a candidate grid
# (against the iterative tuners' `iter` and `initial`), which is what the
# grid-column checks and the zero-row prototype's typing key on; `iterates`
# says its metrics tables carry `.iter`, and that its final fit's print
# reports initial candidates and iterations, scored beside requested
# (`procedure_counts()`). `label` is the search's name in that print.
