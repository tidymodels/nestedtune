#' Build a nested resampling design without copying the data per outer fold
#'
#' `nested_resamples()` builds the same nested resampling structure as
#' [rsample::nested_cv()], but stores index vectors into the original data
#' instead of a materialized analysis set for every outer fold. For the same
#' seed and the same specifications it produces the same splits; what changes is
#' the size of the object that holds them.
#'
#' [rsample::nested_cv()] evaluates the inner specification against
#' `as.data.frame(split)`, so each outer fold's inner resamples reference their
#' own copy of that fold's analysis set. Object size therefore grows by roughly
#' one copy of the data for every outer fold. `nested_resamples()` evaluates the
#' inner specification the same way, against the same transient frame, but keeps
#' only the row indices it produces and remaps them onto the original data, so
#' the inner splits reference the single shared copy the caller already has.
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param outside The outer resampling specification, given either as an
#'   unevaluated call such as `vfold_cv(v = 5)` or as an already-evaluated
#'   `rset` object.
#' @param inside The inner resampling specification, given as an unevaluated
#'   call such as `vfold_cv(v = 5)`. Unlike `outside`, this cannot be an
#'   existing object, because it is evaluated once per outer fold.
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. All three arguments above are required,
#'   so the barrier is what turns a mistyped fourth into an error.
#'
#' @return An object of class `nested_resamples`, which also carries the classes
#'   [rsample::nested_cv()] returns, so methods written against those keep
#'   working. It is the outer `rset` with an `inner_resamples` list column
#'   added, one inner `rset` per outer split.
#'
#' @section Differences from rsample:
#'
#' The splits select the same rows. [rsample::analysis()] and
#' [rsample::assessment()] return identical frames, attributes included, and
#' each inner split carries the class and the resample id rsample gives it, so
#' `labels()` and [rsample::add_resample_id()] behave the same. What differs is
#' what the splits point at: nestedtune's index the original data, rsample's
#' index a materialized copy of each outer fold's analysis set. One behavior
#' differs on purpose.
#'
#' An **outer bootstrap is refused**, not warned about. The same observation can
#' otherwise land in both the inner analysis and the inner assessment set, which
#' makes the design invalid rather than merely unusual.
