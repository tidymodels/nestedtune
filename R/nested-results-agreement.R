# How often each candidate was selected across the outer folds.
#
# summary() prints the selections one parameter at a time and autoplot() draws
# them; this is the same fact as a table, keyed by the whole selected
# combination rather than by one parameter (M44, issue #36). Nothing here ranks
# the folds or names a winner: the most frequent row is a description of the
# procedure's choices, and the final model's parameters come from
# nested_final_fit() running the same procedure on the whole data (D-014).

#' Tabulate how often each candidate was selected across the outer folds
#'
#' @description
#' Each outer fold of a nested resampling run tunes on its own inner resamples
#' and selects one candidate. `agreement()` counts those selections: one row per
#' distinct combination of selected parameter values, with how many completed
#' outer folds chose it and what proportion of them that is, most frequent
#' first.
#'
#' The most frequent combination is **not** the final model's parameters.
#' The outer folds describe how stable the tuning procedure's choice is; the
#' model to deploy comes from [nested_final_fit()], which runs the same
#' procedure once more on the whole dataset and selects for itself.
#'
#' @param x A `nested_results` object from [nested_tune_grid()] or
#'   [nested_tune_bayes()].
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored.
#'
#' @return A tibble with one column per parameter any completed fold's
#'   selection recorded, holding the values as the folds selected them,
#'   followed by `n`, the number of completed outer folds that selected that
#'   combination, and `prop`, `n` divided by the number of completed outer
#'   folds. Rows are ordered by `n` decreasing, ties in the order the
#'   combination first appears among the object's rows. Every completed fold is
#'   counted once, so when the table has rows `sum(n)` is the number of
#'   completed folds. tune's `.config` label is not a column: it names a
#'   candidate within one fold's own tuning run, and folds can search different
#'   grids.
#'
#'   A completed fold whose selection carries no value for a parameter is
#'   counted under `NA` for that parameter, in the same row as a fold that
#'   selected `NA` for it; [summary.nested_results()] reports the two apart. A
#'   workflow with nothing to tune gives a tibble with columns `n` and `prop`
#'   and no rows. A parameter whose id is `n` or `prop` cannot be tabulated,
#'   because its column would collide with the counts, and is an error.
#'
#' A run in which some outer folds failed is tabulated over the folds that
#' completed, with a warning saying so; a run in which no fold completed is an
#' error with condition class `nestedtune_no_completed_folds`, as it is for
#' [collect_metrics()], [autoplot()][autoplot.nested_results] and
#' [nested_final_fit()].
