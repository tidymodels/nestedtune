# Plotting a nested_results.
#
# Both views derive every fact from the columns at plot time rather than from the
# counts stamped at construction, exactly as printing does: a subset's rows are
# their own run (IP4).
#
# Two properties are structural rather than cosmetic. Every *attempted* fold
# keeps its slot on the x axis and a fold that contributed nothing draws no
# point, so a figure lifted out of its console session still shows that the
# design fell short. And the marked estimate is read off the same
# `summarize_folds()` that `collect_metrics()` uses, never recomputed, so the
# plot and the summary cannot disagree about the number.

#' Plot a nested cross-validation result
#'
#' @description
#' Two views of a `nested_results` object, both drawing one point per outer
#' fold with the folds in design order.
#'
#' `type = "parameters"`, the default, shows what each outer fold's inner
#' tuning selected. A flat row of points means the folds agreed; points at
#' different heights mean they disagreed, and the tuning procedure is unstable
#' on this data, which averaging the metrics hides. This is the view nothing
#' else in the ecosystem offers.
#'
#' `type = "performance"` shows each outer fold's score on its held-out
#' assessment set, with a rule at the nested estimate: the same value
#' [collect_metrics()] reports.
#'
#' @param object A `nested_results` object from [nested_tune_grid()] or
#'   [nested_tune_bayes()].
#' @param type Which view to draw: `"parameters"` (the default) or
#'   `"performance"`.
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored.
#'
#' @return A `ggplot` object.
#'
#' @details
#' An outer fold that failed keeps its place on the x axis and draws no point,
#' as does a fold that completed without recording a value for a parameter.
#' Neither is imputed and neither is dropped from the axis, so the shortfall is
#' visible in the figure itself. A run in which no fold completed is refused
#' with condition class `nestedtune_no_completed_folds`, as
#' [collect_metrics()], [agreement()] and [nested_final_fit()] refuse it.
#'
#' The subtitle states how much of the requested design ran. Contribution is
#' counted per panel instead, because it differs between them: a panel says so
#' when fewer folds contributed to it than completed, as in `mtry (2 of 3
#' chose)` or `rmse (from 2 folds)`; an unqualified panel means every
#' completed fold contributed. A requested metric that no completed fold
#' could score keeps an empty panel rather than disappearing.
#'
#' The selected-value axis is numeric when every value drawn is a number, and
#' discrete otherwise: a single axis cannot be both, and character-valued
#' tuning parameters are ordinary. A fold that selected `NA` is a value on that
#' discrete axis rather than an absent point.
