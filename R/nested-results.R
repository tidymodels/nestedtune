# #32: rows may be reordered but never added or removed, and columns may be
# added or reordered. An operation inside that set gets the class back; anything
# else gets a bare tibble, because an object holding rows other than the ones
# the run produced cannot answer for the run and must stop claiming it can
# (IP4). The alternative -- what this class did until M36 -- is what makes
# `slice(x, 1)` return a one-row object still headed "3-fold cross-validation".
#
# Only `dplyr_reconstruct()` is registered. dplyr's default `dplyr_row_slice()`
# and `dplyr_col_modify()` both finish by calling it, and so does `bind_rows()`,
# so one method covers the verbs; `[` is the one door that does not lead here on
# its own, and is routed here explicitly below.
#
# What the rule cannot see (M49). `[` and `rbind()` take the object they act
# on as their own template, so a record column altered under the class --
# `x$.inner_metrics[[1]] <- ...`, which tibble's `$<-` reattaches the class
# after without consulting this rule (measured 2026-09-02) -- is compared
# against itself by those two doors and passes; they refuse a removal only.
# The two template-taking doors, `dplyr_reconstruct()` and `vec_restore()`,
# refuse the alteration against the original.

# Which of an object's columns are the design's own fold labels.
#
# Read off the record the constructor wrote, never derived from the names in
# hand. It is the only place the answer is given -- record_columns(),
# has_results_columns(), can_reconstruct_results() and fold_ids() all ask here,
# so the class cannot hold two ideas of what a label column is.
#
# Until M38 this matched a name pattern, and every review round bought one more
# spelling. A bare `^id` prefix caught `ideal` and `id_extra`, names a caller
# joins in to label folds with; anchoring it to `^id[0-9]*$` left `id2`, which
# rsample gives a repeated design and a caller may add to a plain one. No
# pattern separates those two, because they are spelled identically and only the
# design knows which it is -- so the design is asked once, at construction, and
# the answer is carried with the run's description.

# refuses rather than guessing: the conservative direction M36 review O6 already

#' Collect the metrics from a nested resampling run

#' @param x A `nested_results` object from [nested_tune_grid()] or
#'   [nested_tune_bayes()].
#' @param summarize Whether to average the per-fold metrics (`TRUE`, the

#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored.
#'
#' @return A tibble. Summarized, one row per metric -- and, for a metric
#'   measured at evaluation times, per evaluation time -- with the mean across
#'   outer folds, the number of folds contributing, and the standard error of
#'   that mean. Unsummarized, one row per outer fold and metric -- and per
#'   evaluation time, where a metric was measured at several. Both carry a
#'   `.eval_time` column exactly when the run was scored by a dynamic or
#'   integrated survival metric, as tune's own `collect_metrics()` does; on a
#'   static metric's row beside one, it is `NA`.
#'
#' @details
#' The summarized value is the nested cross-validation estimate: what the
#' tune-and-fit procedure achieves on data it never saw. It is not the
#' performance of any model you have in hand.
#'
#' Only the outer folds that completed are summarized, and `n` counts the folds
#' contributing to each row, so a run with failures never reports its estimate
#' as though the whole design had run. Those folds are dropped with a warning
#' naming them; when no fold completed at all, this errors instead of returning
#' `NA`, with condition class `nestedtune_no_completed_folds` -- the class
#' [autoplot()][autoplot.nested_results], [agreement()] and
#' [nested_final_fit()] refuse such an object with.
#'
#' A metric measured at several evaluation times (`eval_time` on
#' [nested_tune_grid()]) is summarized per time, never averaged across them:
#' each row's `mean` is over the fold estimates at the time it names.
#'
#' @section Reading `std_err`:
#'
#' `std_err` is the standard error of the mean across outer folds: the standard
#' deviation of the per-fold scores divided by the square root of how many there
#' were. It is the precision of that mean, not the fold-to-fold spread, which is
#' larger by the same square-root factor. It is **not** a confidence interval for
#' the estimate, and one should not be built from it.
#'
#' That is a limit of the statistics rather than of this implementation. Outer
#' fold scores are not independent (any two folds share most of their training
#' rows), so a standard error computed as though they were can misstate the
#' uncertainty, typically downward. Bengio and Grandvalet (2004) proved there is
#' no universally unbiased estimator of a k-fold cross-validation estimate's
#' variance to put in its place. Gauran, Ombao and Yu (2025) measured what that
#' costs inside a nested design: several of their test statistics built on a
#' variance-based denominator rejected a true null far more often than the
#' nominal 5% they were run at (36% and 40% in the worst cells they report),
#' and they recommend against such denominators outright.
#'
#' Both results are about closely related quantities rather than this column
#' exactly: Bengio and Grandvalet study the variance of a k-fold estimate built
#' from per-observation losses, and Gauran and colleagues work inside ridge and
#' LASSO designs. Neither gap rescues the column: no interval here is
#' oracle-backed, which is the practical point.
#'
#' The column is reported because `tune` reports it and users expect the shape;
#' no inferential claim is made with it.
