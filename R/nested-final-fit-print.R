# The object holds a tuning run, and that run has metrics: the full-data
# resampling estimate at the selected configuration. It is plain CV subject to
# selection optimism over the grid, and it wears tune's authoritative clothes.
# No number from it appears here (RR02 Q7). What appears instead is the sentence
# saying where this model's honest estimate lives, because a print method is
# where a user meets the object.

#' completed and requested. It can score fewer initial candidates than
#' `initial` names and can stop short of `iter`.

#' Summarize a final fit
#'
#' @description
#' `summary()` gives you the facts of the final fit as values rather than
#' printed lines. Those are the full-data tuning run the selection came
#' from, which search ran it and at what counts, how many parameter
#' settings it scored, and which values it chose.
#'
#' The `estimate` component is always `NULL`, and that is the point. The
#' stored tuning run's metrics are selection-time quantities, so this object
#' records the absence of a performance number rather than leaving the name
#' out. See [nested_final_fit()] for the number to report instead.
#'
#' @param object A `nested_final_fit` object from [nested_final_fit()].
#' @inheritParams print.nested_final_fit
#'
#' @return
#' `summary()` returns an object of class `summary.nested_final_fit`, a list
#' with these components:
#'
#' - `tuning_label`, the tuning run's resampling label
#' - `tuner`, the name of the tune or finetune function that ran, as
#'   [extract_procedure()] records it
#' - `candidates`, the number of parameter settings that run scored
#' - `initial` and `initial_requested`, `iterations_completed` and
#'   `iterations_requested`, the iterating tuners' counts
#' - `selection`, the parameter values selection chose
#' - `estimate`, always `NULL`
#'
#' Printing it is what most callers want. The components are there for a
#' caller that needs a value rather than a line of text.
#'
#' @section Components that are absent:
#'
#' The four counts are `NULL` on a grid or a racing fit, which iterate over
#' nothing. They are carried rather than dropped, for the reason `estimate`
#' is. The scored figures are counted from the tuning run's metrics table,
#' and the requested ones are the counts the search was called with. A run
#' whose metrics table cannot be read reports its scored figures as zero
#' rather than failing to print.
#'
#' Where nothing was tuned there is no run to describe, so `tuning_label`
#' is `NULL` and `candidates` is `0`. `selection` is empty.
