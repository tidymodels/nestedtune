#' Summarize a final fit
#'
#' @description
#' Answers what the final fit means: the full-data tuning run the selection
#' came from, which procedure ran it and at what counts, how many candidates
#' that run scored, which parameter values it selected, and where this
#' model's honest performance estimate lives.
#'
#' The estimate component is always `NULL`, and that is the point. The tuning
#' run stored on the object has metrics, but selection consumed them and they
#' are optimistically biased as a claim about this model; the nested estimate
#' on the results object the fit was built from -- the [nested_tune_grid()] or
#' [nested_tune_bayes()] result -- is the one to report (IP3). The absence is
#' carried as a component rather than left out, so a caller reading the
#' summary meets a recorded fact instead of a missing name; the four Bayesian
#' counts are carried as `NULL` on a grid fit for the same reason.
#'
#' @param object A `nested_final_fit` object from [nested_final_fit()].
#' @param ... Not used; must be empty. An argument passed here is an error
#'   rather than silently ignored.

#' @return
#' `summary()` returns an object of class `summary.nested_final_fit`: a list
#' holding the full-data tuning run's resampling label (`tuning_label`), the
#' tuner that ran (`tuner`: `"tune_grid"`, `"tune_bayes"`, `"tune_race_anova"`,
#' `"tune_race_win_loss"` or `"tune_sim_anneal"`), the number of
#' candidates that run scored (`candidates`), the iterating tuners' counts
#' (`initial` and `initial_requested`, `iterations_completed` and
#' `iterations_requested`, each `NULL` on a grid or a racing fit; the scored figures are
#' read from the candidate record, the requested ones from the procedure, and
#' a run whose candidate record cannot be derived reports its scored figures
#' as zero rather than failing to print), the
#' parameter values selection chose (`selection`), and an `estimate`
#' component that is always `NULL`. Printing it is what most callers want;
#' the components are there for a caller that needs a value rather than a
