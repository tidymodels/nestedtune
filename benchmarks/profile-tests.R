# Where the test suite spends its time, per file.
#
# Run this, not `system.time(devtools::test())`: the number that matters is the
# per-file breakdown, and a single wall-clock total hides which file is worth
# converting. Usage, from the package root:
#
#   Rscript benchmarks/profile-tests.R [runs]
#
# The measurement conditions are deliberately those of a SERIAL
# `devtools::test()` and not of `R CMD check`: the package is loaded ONCE with
# pkgload::load_all(), the helper files are sourced ONCE, and every test file
# then runs in a child of that one environment. That is the condition a suite-level fixture cache
# lives in -- run each file in its own session instead and every cache starts
# empty, which measures a different thing.
#
# NOT_CRAN is set to "true" for the same reason devtools does: tests that skip
# on CRAN are part of what a developer waits for.
